        <p>THE deep coves of the Connecticut River provided the protected harbor that made Essex the region's predominant shipping and shipbuilding port from before the Revolutionary War to the advent of the railroads in the mid-1800's. Situated six miles upriver from the Long Island Sound and safe from its stormy tides, this town of 6,000 continues to bond with the water, but now for pleasure rather than for commerce.</p>
        <p>Although some people consider a boat a  virtual necessity here, a small house and a well-worn canoe may lie next door to a mansion with a pier and a 60-foot yacht. Since the mid-1600's development has reflected a colonial sense of community, minimizing the number of neighborhoods based on income or architectural style.</p>
        <p>''People don't put as much value here on how big your house is, what car you drive, or how many things you've acquired,'' said Terry Smith, a ''newcomer'' who moved to Essex, about 30 miles east of New Haven,  from Oyster Bay, N.Y., five years ago. ''If you want to have an extravagant birthday party for your child, you can. But if you want to keep it simple, that's not an issue.''</p>
        <p>Her husband, Brant Smith, is a senior partner in Smith Hanley Associates, an executive search firm in Manhattan. Like many people, he has been freed from a daily commute by the communications revolution. ''I go into New York once a week now,'' he said. ''I enjoy Essex immensely. It has people from every walk of life, and they are heavily involved as volunteers with the running of the town.''</p>
        <p>Vintage homes lining the narrow village streets have been restored in a low-key  style. One reason for the number of such homes, said Donald Malcarne, the town historian, is that ''poverty preserves.'' He explained that when the railroads replaced boats, Essex suffered a long economic downturn. ''Those houses are still standing,'' he said. ''Nobody wanted them until they got discovered by Fairfield County and Westchester County and New York City.''</p>
        <p>Richard T. Weiner, an associate broker at the Mitchel Agency, a local real estate company, said: ''Essex is the sort of community people are looking for these days. ''Good schools, light traffic, beautiful scenery, no 'cookie cutter' homes or stores, access to the water, and crime is almost nonexistent.'' There is one traffic light, one resident state trooper and three constables. The volunteer fire department has a roster of 56 firefighters and a new $2 million firehouse.</p>
        <p>Talbot's is the only chain store. The local  shops along Main Street bear names like  Hastings House Asian and English Antiques, the Clipper Ship Independent Bookstore, Debbie's Restaurant and Drugstore, and the Essex Coffee &amp; Tea Company.</p>
        <p>''You have to go out about three miles to find a dry cleaner or a supermarket,'' said Skip Hubbard, the publisher of The Main Street News, the local weekly. Here, the emphasis is on old-fashioned service. For example, Bennie's, a 65-year-old family-owned market, cuts meats to order (no prepackaging), does not mist the lettuce and roasts beef and chicken daily for takeout lunches.</p>
        <p>The Town of Essex is made up of three parts. Essex village, which lies along the river, bustles with shops and restaurants.  The Town Hall can be found here, plus a number of yacht clubs, marinas and boat launches. Its homes date from the 18th century.</p>
        <p>TO the west of the village, in a triangle bounded by Routes 604, 602 and 153, Centerbrook has a number of commercial and light-industrial buildings in and around Essex Industrial Park, but it is also growing as a retail and residential location.</p>
        <p>Ivoryton, to the north and west of Centerbrook, was named for the 19th-century Comstock-Cheney factory where most of the world's ivory piano keys were made until plastics took over 50 years ago. The factory has now been converted to a multiuse commercial building.</p>
        <p>Of the total of 2,900 dwellings in the town, most are single-family homes. About 65 houses and a couple of condominiums are currently for sale in what is generally characterized as a tight market. Roger Parkman, a broker in Essex office of DeWolfe New England, said: ''People coming here from outside want to be in the village or within walking distance, where house prices start in the low $300,000's. Prices in Centerbrook and Ivoryton may be 5 to 10 percent less.''</p>
        <p>Among the highest-priced homes now on the market is the $1.2 million mansion built in 1830 by E. E. Dickinson, the founder of the witch-hazel distillery that operated in Essex for 150 years (the factory has been converted to mixed commercial uses). Overlooking North Cove and the Connecticut River, the house has 26 rooms and 10 fireplaces.</p>
        <p>For people who want a new house, there are three subdivisions available. ''At Farm Hill Estates in Ivoryton, 22 one-acre home sites are available and one spec house has been built for $459,500,'' said Cathy Schellan of Prudential Connecticut Dunham Realtors, which is handling the sales.</p>
        <p>At two other developments, Southwinds, off Route 153, and Windswept Ridge, off Old Dobbin Road in Ivoryton, seven houses are available at each, at prices ranging from $320,000 to $550,000. The DeWolfe office in Old Saybrook, Conn., is handling the sales.</p>
        <p>Future development may be curtailed if a zoning proposal that would raise the minimum lot size from one to two acres is  approved and implemented this summer. ''There was not one speaker or letter in opposition at the public hearing,'' said Peter B. Webster, the first selectman. ''It's a major change that will preserve enough good soil for septics and wells.''</p>
        <p>Weston and Sharon Bray, who now live in Wilton, Conn., with their two children, ages 7 and 9, are moving to Essex, but doing it gradually to accommodate business and family adjustments. ''We're concerned about how developed Fairfield County is getting, so we bought a 5,000-square-foot house on the water in Essex,'' said Mr. Bray, the chief executive of Marketing Drive Worldwide, a global marketing services company with headquarters in Wilton. ''We'll move our two children, two dogs, two cats and two birds over the course of three years,'' he said. ''We like the distinctive seafaring heritage of Essex, and the Gris has the best bar in Connecticut.''</p>
        <p>The Gris (pronounced Griz) is short for the Griswold, a historic 32-room inn and tavern built on Main Street in 1776 and now owned by the three Paul brothers, Doug, Geoff and Greg. The Griswold bills itself as the oldest continuously operating inn in the state, and its taproom, built in 1748 as the town's first schoolhouse, has a domed ceiling made of a clamshell plaster strengthened with horsehair.</p>
        <p>Dinner for two with wine, tax and tip can run to $125, and rooms are $90 to $195 a night. At Christmastime, the menu features game -- venison, moose, pheasant and quail -- served by a staff in colonial costumes while diners are serenaded by madrigal singers.</p>
        <p>ANOTHER well-known Essex hostelry is the Copper Beech Inn, built in the 1880's by the Comstock family, the co-owner of the piano key factory, as their residence. Most of the 23 rooms in the house and converted barn have Victorian furnishings. A favorite dish in the restaurant is  bouillabaisse made with local fish. Dinner for two with wine, tax and tip runs around $120, and rooms are $105 to $175, including  breakfast.</p>
        <p>The Essex schools emphasize individualized instruction, and the pupil-teacher ratio is about 15 to 1. Essex Elementary School has an enrollment of about 500 students in kindergarten through the sixth grade. From there, students go on to the regional John Winthrop Middle School and to the Valley Regional High School District No. 4, both in Deep River, Conn.</p>
        <p>In College Board tests last year students' verbal scores averaged 530 and math scores averaged 523, compared with statewide averages of 510 for verbal and 509 for math.  About 80 percent of the 87 graduates in the class of 2000 are going on to college.</p>
        <p>''The high school operates on a four-period day with 80-minute classes,'' said Dr. John Gillespie, the superintendent of the Valley Regional School District No. 4. ''This enables students to complete a year's work in half a year and take a greater variety of courses. And it allows teachers more flexibility.''</p>
        <p>The Essex Yacht Club, the largest of five private yacht clubs, has 40 slips, 70 moorings and a restaurant; its waiting list now runs about a year. Among the numerous marinas are Brewer's Dauntless Shipyard and the Essex Island Marina, which occupies a 13-acre island in the Connecticut River and offers a restaurant, pool and dockage for boats up to 200 feet at $2.65 a foot.</p>
        <p>One of Essex's cultural landmarks is the venerable Ivoryton Playhouse, a year-round theater where Katharine Hepburn, Marlon Brando, Tallulah Bankhead, Mae West and  other stars have performed.</p>
        <p>Baseball, soccer and tennis are available at four town fields and four town tennis courts at no charge. The operation of recreational activities, including instruction, is left to community volunteers. ''That's how we keep the tax rate down,'' said Don Mesite, who volunteers as the chairman of the parks and recreation commission.</p>
