        <p>James Stack, a leading market analyst and financial adviser based in Whitefish, Mont., is known for taking a conservative approach when confronted with risks. But last April 11, he threw caution aside and risked his life to save a drowning man.</p>
        <p>That night, a motorboat capsized in Whitefish Lake, throwing Randall Bruckner and Julia Cassidy into 39-degree water. Mr. Stack, who has a home on the lake and heard their cries, jumped into his kayak, paddled out and pulled Mr. Bruckner ashore. Others helped Ms. Cassidy, who later died of hypothermia.</p>
        <p>Last month, the Carnegie Hero Fund Commission, established by Andrew Carnegie in 1904 to recognize acts of bravery, selected Mr. Stack, 47, as one of its Carnegie Heroes. He was among 22 Americans and Canadians honored this year who risked their lives trying to save others. The awards include bronze medals and  $3,000 grants.</p>
        <p>Mr. Stack's company, Investech, emphasizes safety. His professional caution, he said, stemmed from the rough markets of the 1970's.</p>
        <p>Though he may seem less cautious once his workday is done, he still calculates risks and returns. ''My market philosophy doesn't interfere with everyday life,'' he said. ''When I heard their cries I knew it was a life-and-death situation. I knew I could control my own odds.''</p>
        <p>His family would like him to emphasize odds control a little more in the future: if solo kayak rescues on frigid lakes in the dark became a habit, he said, ''they'd shoot me.''</p>
