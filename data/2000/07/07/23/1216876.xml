        <p>JOEL LEGATT grinned into the dressing table mirror, searching for his dimples. Spotting them beneath his white clown makeup, he painted a thin black line in the dent on each cheek. Voila! The canvas -- his own face -- was no longer blank. Mr. Legatt had begun to invent his character.</p>
        <p>Mark Gindick, a professional clown, looked on approvingly. ''Boootiful -- I'm loving it!'' he declared.</p>
        <p>Face powder swirled around him, and around the room, as members of the cast of ''Pippin,'' a Scarsdale Summer Music Theater production, which will open on Aug. 3, filed in three by three to learn makeup techniques from Mr. Gindick and Emily Sullivan, another clown.</p>
        <p>''We're just playing right now, just figuring things out,'' Mr. Gindick told the cast members, who are high school and college students. He watched Joy Serwatka paint tiny inverted V's above her eyes. ''I'm totally loving your eyebrows,'' he said. ''They're so different from everyone else's.''</p>
        <p>Each cast member had a makeup kit, donated by Michelle Danielle Day Spa in Chappaqua. It was street makeup, not theatrical makeup, but with enough colors (for eyes, mostly) to keep Picasso happy. Al Stuart, the producer, said the 25 kits cost a total of $10,000. The show also requires red, white and black makeup, suitable for the comedia del arte style of ''Pippin.''</p>
        <p>''I'm loving that it's uneven,'' Mr. Gindick told anyone striving for perfect hearts, diamonds or teardrops. ''Whenever things are lopsided, it adds character.''</p>
        <p>Out of character, Mr. Gindick is a slight 24-year-old with curly brown hair and glasses. A 1994 graduate of Scarsdale High School's Alternative School, he has studied filmmaking at Purchase College and clowning at Ringling Brothers and Barnum &amp; Bailey Clown College in Sarasota, Fla. He also toured for a year with the Ringling Brothers circus and is now enrolled at Purchase in the drama division, where he is honing what he calls a no-makeup theatrical clown show called ''How to Be a Man.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Gindick is also an alumnus of Scarsdale's popular summer theater program, which provides seven weeks of professional- level instruction to its participants for tuition of $135. Besides learning to do their own makeup, this year's cast members have learned sword play techniques and magic tricks taught by a professional magician. Mr. Stuart promised a few surprises in each performance.</p>
        <p>''Our objective is to give the students a Broadway theatrical experience,'' Mr. Stuart said. ''We don't treat them like kids.'' He said the budget this year was about $43,000, which comes from ticket sales, program advertisements and donations.</p>
        <p>''Pippin'' can be seen from Aug. 3 through 5 and from Aug. 10 through 12 at 8 p.m. in the Scarsdale High School auditorium. Tickets are $15, $12 for children, students and those over 65. The number to call for tickets is (914) 472-1727.</p>
