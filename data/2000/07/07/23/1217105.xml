        <p>''POWER PLAYS'' has its roots in a course that John O. Whitney originated at the Columbia Business School.  Of late, Professor Whitney and Tina Packer, the book's authors, have shared the teaching, as they explain in these excerpts from an interview.</p>
        <p>FRED ANDREWS</p>
        <p>Q.  Are there particular parts of Shakespeare that resonate with the students?</p>
        <p>WHITNEY -- We start out with ''Richard II'' and I was surprised. I didn't think people were going to like ''Richard II'' that much, but it provided a darned good foundation for the first few classes. They just saw all the weaknesses, so beautifully portrayed, of a weak leader --</p>
        <p>PACKER -- -- the one that loves the trappings of power. Secretly, everybody wants the trappings of power.</p>
        <p>WHITNEY -- And they love the language of it.</p>
        <p>Q. Do business students respond to the beauty of the language?</p>
        <p>PACKER -- The idea that there is something this beautiful out there certainly hits a lot of the students. And the part of their souls which has been starved starts coming alive again.  Something more than getting and spending.</p>
        <p>Q.  If Richard II is a woeful leader, who is the best?</p>
        <p>PACKER -- Oh, Henry V, I would say.</p>
        <p>WHITNEY -- Henry V is the popular one, but in the book Tina does a thing with Rosalind in ''As You Like It,'' and I think Rosalind is as good a leader. I like Henry V, too.</p>
        <p>PACKER -- He has the classic moment. You know, if you're in a right old mess and the odds are against you, you better pull something out of the bag, and it better be really good. And you better concentrate not on all the terrible things that are going to happen, but on all the great things that could happen, if you really fight and fight hard. It is the great heroic speech.</p>
        <p>Q.  Does Hamlet make an impact?</p>
        <p>PACKER -- The students have a great attraction to Hamlet because of this idea of thinking about it too much. Learning to live with there not being a perfect answer is a skill a really good reader has to handle.</p>
        <p>Q. You have been teaching the course together?</p>
        <p>PACKER -- We taught one semester together and I taught it last semester, and John's been teaching it through the summer. I taught one before that, and we're going to try teaching the one in the fall together.</p>
        <p>WHITNEY -- I've got 90 students this summer.  When Tina and I taught it together, we had to go to two sections, 120 students. When I first announced it -- I taught it by myself the first time -- they told me downstairs we had 400 people trying to get in.</p>
        <p>Q. What happens when you two disagree?</p>
        <p>PACKER -- You can tell from the book we have quite a lot of differences in perspective. One of the things we like about each other enormously is that we both like life. We both like laughing; we both like fighting.</p>
        <p>WHITNEY -- It's just like Shakespeare.</p>
