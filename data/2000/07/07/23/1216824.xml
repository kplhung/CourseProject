        <p>THE PROBABLE WORLD</p>
        <p>By Lawrence Raab.</p>
        <p>Penguin, paper, $15.95.</p>
        <p>It's an old idea in American poetry that poems should sound like speech, but Lawrence Raab still breaks new ground in this area, albeit unobtrusively, in keeping with the understated tone of his work: throughout this new collection -- his fifth -- he makes his case almost entirely through inflection. You understand him as soon as you hear the qualifications in his voice, which can range from quietly humorous to grave, though always with a delicate sense of questioning, as if he were never fully decided about anything. ''Perhaps / that's what civilization means, / knowing too much to be able to feel / only one way,'' he writes in ''Big Ideas,'' in which he dismisses ideas that look ''more like excuses for hatred'' (and then hints at what the civilized are capable of: ''we watch the news, we read the papers, / afraid, sometimes, of what we understand''). Raab's is a practical-minded poetry; whether its subjects are hunting, Hamlet or the afterlife, the large questions relate to ordinary circumstances. ''Nothing mysterious ever happened / in our church,'' he begins ''My Spiritual Life,'' and it's not a complaint. ''Our minister explained that we were good, / But could be better . . . / Week by week we were on our own.'' Transcendent moments still occur, though in language that's as plain as day. A graceful writer, Raab has no interest in stylistic variation. But he does have a voice that puzzles over everything, and that rescues ''The Probable World'' from monotony.</p>
