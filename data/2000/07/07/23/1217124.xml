        <p>Warren Buffett at Berkshire Hathaway gets a great deal of attention, but Maurice R 'Hank' Greenberg at American International Group has posted a significantly better return for 10-year period ended June 30, 2000; Buffett and Greenberg have created very different public images for themselves, but in fact they have a great deal in common, as do their firms, which are both fundamentally insurance businesses that have delivered immense value to shareholders; photos, graphs, chronology (L)</p>

        <p>ONE plays the part of the hayseed, the other the quintessential New York tough guy, complete with flinty stare and a vocabulary that might stun the crowd at a hip-hop concert. One loves bridge and jokes that he reluctantly drags himself around a golf course; the other is a bundle of energy whose idea of relaxation is rocketing down a frozen ski trail.</p>
        <p>Look deeper, though, and these two men -- Warren E. Buffett of Omaha and Maurice R. Greenberg of Manhattan -- have more in common than what sets them apart. By dint of intellect and Olympian drive, each has built a far-rearching empire that for decades has delivered immense value to shareholders. Each rules his company -- Mr. Buffett at Berkshire Hathaway, Mr. Greenberg at the American International Group -- with imperial authority, in gracious defiance of the conventions of good corporate government.</p>
        <p>More to the point, Mr. Greenberg, who is 75 and known as Hank, and Mr. Buffett, who will be 70 in August, are giants in the same game. Though both Berkshire, quite famously, and A.I.G., less obviously, have other operations, each is mainly in the insurance business; it represents nearly 80 percent of Mr. Buffett's revenue, and, along with related financial services, nearly all of Mr. Greenberg's. Glamorless? Unexciting? Maybe -- until you understand that both see it as the business of deploying assets to the greatest possible gain. ''We think alike,'' Mr. Buffett said recently. ''If you showed us 10 deals, we would probably come to pretty similar conclusions on most of them.''</p>
        <p>And that makes all the more extraordinary this simple fact: For 10 years, Mr. Greenberg's company has, for investors, been the better bet.</p>
        <p>Berkshire, of course, has been a spectacular long-haul investment. A stake of $10,000 sunk into Mr. Buffett's holding-company-cum-investment-fund in 1965 has grown to about $39 million. Built for long-term investors -- Class A shares, never split, now sell for $53,300, a price that discourages trading -- Berkshire has minted many a millionaire and has made Mr. Buffett an investing icon.</p>
        <p>Yet an investor who plopped down $10,000 in Berkshire on June 30, 1990 -- a lifetime ago, by today's market standards -- would have had $25,600 less on June 30, 2000, than one who bought an equal stake in A.I.G.: $74,700 versus $100,300. Over five years, the gap is even greater: $10,000 invested in A.I.G. in June 1995 would have grown to $44,100 through June 2000, while the same amount in Berkshire would have grown to just under $23,000.</p>
        <p>Mr. Buffett's recent underperformance of both the stock market and his own historical record is no secret. Last year, Berkshire's gain in net worth was less than 1 percent -- the ''absolute worst performance of my tenure,'' he has acknowledged. And he offers his investors little reason for optimism. Unbending in his value discipline, Mr. Buffett says he finds it increasingly difficult to uncover companies or stocks worth buying. Over the coming decade, he says,  Berkshire's gains will probably only modestly surpass those of the Standard &amp; Poor's 500-stock index.</p>
        <p>Mr. Greenberg makes no such concessions. He has been averaging annual earnings growth of about 20 percent since taking A.I.G. public in 1969, two years after he rose to chief executive; the stock has gone up at about the same pace. As for the future, ''I don't see anything that's going to rock that boat,'' Mr. Greenberg said in a conversation this month at the company's Art Deco skyscraper on Pine Street in Manhattan's financial district.</p>
        <p>That may be hubris on Mr. Greenberg's part, and Mr. Buffett's modesty may be misplaced: his protestations of fallibility have often preceded stellar performance. Indeed, the fading of technology stocks this spring and the revival, at least temporarily, of the consumer and financial sectors he favors have helped Berkshire Class A shares rebound about 30 percent from a low of $40,800 in March.</p>
        <p>But the long-term numbers don't lie. A.I.G. -- today the pre-eminent American commercial insurer, with operations in more than 130 countries -- has earned comparison to Berkshire as a vehicle for long-term investors. And it is high time, too, to examine Mr. Greenberg's legacy in the same light as Mr. Buffett's.</p>
        <p>A.I.G. is not as well known on Main Street as Berkshire. But on Wall Street, said Doug MacKay, a portfolio manager at Oak Associates, a mutual fund company that holds more than seven million A.I.G. shares, ''Maurice Greenberg is just legendary.''</p>
        <p>Opposite Styles of Investing</p>
        <p>Mr. Greenberg may act like the tough guy, but when it comes to investing A.I.G.'s capital, he turns cautious. The company, which has $268 billion in assets, making it the largest American insurance company, has a classic insurance securities portfolio, heavy with high-quality bonds and constructed to produce steady gains. His acquisitions and new ventures generally amplify the successes of the past.</p>
        <p>For his part, Mr. Buffett invests like a riverboat gambler, limiting his market plays to a few big bets and buying up companies with little in common except that they are moneymakers with superb managers and products that he personally likes.</p>
        <p>''Berkshire will buy businesses with very volatile earnings if the returns are high enough,'' said Alice Schroeder, an analyst at Morgan Stanley Dean Witter who has studied both companies. ''A.I.G. wants companies that produce predictable earnings over time.''</p>
        <p>A.I.G., she added, ''likes to have its capital fully allocated at all times;  Berkshire is an opportunistic investor.''</p>
        <p>Trained as an investor, not as a businessman, Mr. Buffett was first drawn to the insurance business in the mid-1960's by the money -- other people's money, that is. The float on premium payments can be put to work earning investment profits until a claim is filed.</p>
        <p>Mr. Greenberg is an insurance man from the ground up. An Army veteran of the Normandy invasion, he got a law degree and returned to front-line service in the Korean War. Back in New York in 1952, he walked into the office of the Continental Casualty Company and asked for a job.  The personnel manager showed him the door, but Mr. Greenberg tracked down the head of the New York office, who liked his spunk and put him to work as an underwriting trainee.  In late 1960, he joined the insurance company that would become A.I.G. as a senior executive. Seven years later, at the age of 42, he became chief executive.</p>
        <p>Nothing illustrates the differences between the two men's investing personalities so much as their biggest single acquisitions.</p>
        <p>Two years ago, Mr. Buffett moved into the big time in insurance with the purchase of General Re, one of the world's leading reinsurers -- the companies that take on other insurance companies' biggest risks for a share of the premiums.</p>
        <p>Most years, reinsurers collect substantial premiums without having to make big payouts; the float can be very attractive. But the risks of Mr. Buffett's investment quickly rained down on Berkshire: big earthquakes in Turkey and Taiwan contributed to an underwriting loss of more than $1 billion at General Re last year.</p>
        <p>Still, Mr. Buffett loves the company. It has everything it needs, he says, ''to become the world's most profitable reinsurance company.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Greenberg is no stranger to the wild, caroming fortunes of reinsurance; A.I.G. owns 60 percent of TransAtlantic Re, another global leader in the field. But far from a walk on the wild side, his biggest acquisition -- made shortly after Mr. Buffett bought General Re -- was of a company built to be a safe bet.</p>
        <p>That company, SunAmerica, is a leader in variable annuities, which  combine mutual funds and insurance and are blazing new sales records as baby boomers fret about retirement. The business itself is one giant annuity for A.I.G., piling up money in long-term investments from customers and throwing off management fees.</p>
        <p>''We could have bought a commercial bank,'' Mr. Greenberg said, ''but commercial banks, to us, have more volatility in earnings.''</p>
        <p>Still, as Mr. Buffett notes, the two men follow similar disciplines in analyzing a deal. Each carefully studies the financials himself, rather than relying on staff summaries. Mr. Buffett is famous for spending days reading annual reports; Mr. Greenberg seldom leaves the office without two big satchels full of papers.</p>
        <p>''My weekends are playing tennis and reading,'' he said. ''And on the telephone. That's generally my weekend.''</p>
        <p>Reins, Loose and Tight</p>
        <p>As a manager, Mr. Buffett says he tries to keep his hands off Berkshire's companies. But Mr. Greenberg is totally hands-on. As Mr. Buffett puts it, ''He knows when the sparrow falls, and he even knows when the sparrow is thinking of falling.''</p>
        <p>Once a month, Mr. Greenberg assembles his division presidents around a rectangular table in a large, plain room on the 16th floor of A.I.G.'s headquarters. To start ''the chairman's meeting,'' as it is known, he swings his eyes around the room and, like a stern law professor putting students to a test, finally lets his gaze rest on one executive.</p>
        <p>That person has a minute or so to rattle off current sales, expenses, profits and any unusual developments. Then, moving clockwise, each of the other subordinates reports. It can be a crisp, charged atmosphere. Mr. Greenberg tells his people that he wants them to be entrepreneurs. And he wants performance.</p>
        <p>''If they believe you are doing everything you possibly can, they might accept some performance slippage,'' said Susan Rivera, the president of an A.I.G. division that sells workers' compensation and other business insurance. ''But if you're not performing and it's perceived you're not doing all you can, it is a short-lived life.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Greenberg often recruits specialists from other fields and teaches them the insurance business -- as long as they are quick studies. He signed up Joseph L. Boren, who spent years in government and business solving pollution problems, to develop new coverages in his field.</p>
        <p>Mr. Boren, now president of A.I.G. Environmental, has been attending the chairman's meetings for four years. Mr. Greenberg, he said, is ''not denigrating; he's penetrating.''</p>
        <p>''He doesn't say, 'You must be the biggest dope I've ever seen,' '' Mr. Boren added. ''But he might say: 'You're alarming me. You don't sound like you're in control.'</p>
        <p>''In the scheme of things, you'd rather walk into a meeting and have people say to you, 'How are you today? Did you have a nice weekend?' But that isn't how our business works, which is why our business is so successful.''</p>
        <p>A few months ago, when A.I.G. acquired an 8 percent stake in Risk Labs, a dot-com start-up in Atlanta, Mr. Greenberg sent in one of his executives as acting chief executive. That is not the Buffett way. Mr. Buffett says that one reason he buys a company is for its management; when he takes newcomers into the Berkshire fold, he leaves the managers alone. That is his plan for Justin Industries, the maker of Tony Lama boots; Berkshire said last month that it was acquiring the company.</p>
        <p>Indeed, said a senior executive of one of Mr. Buffett's companies, ''if you want to get him involved, you practically have to drag him into it.''</p>
        <p>But he has ways of letting his managers know what he wants done. Years ago, after he acquired 50 percent of Geico, the discount auto insurer that Berkshire now owns entirely, A.I.G. offered to buy the business.</p>
        <p>As John J. Byrne Jr., then Geico's chief executive, tells the story, Mr. Buffett agreed only reluctantly to join him for lunch in Mr. Greenberg's private dining room at A.I.G. Mr. Greenberg and Felix Rohatyn, a friend who was then a senior partner in the Lazard Freres investment banking firm, tried to aim their conversation at Mr. Buffett. ''You're looking at the wrong side of the table,'' he told them. ''You've got to speak to Mr. Byrne.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Byrne felt the chill. The next day he told Mr. Greenberg that Geico was not for sale.</p>
        <p>Another time, though, Mr. Buffett showed that he can lose his cool as readily as any hands-on boss. Mr. Byrne had shifted much of Geico's investment portfolio into long-term bonds -- at precisely the wrong moment. Interest rates were starting to rise, which meant that he would not only soon be locked into below-market yields, but that the value of his bonds would be falling.</p>
        <p>As Mr. Byrne recalls it, Mr. Buffett invited him to play golf at the Burning Tree Club outside Washington. Rather tentatively, Mr. Buffett started to talk about the economy, and Mr. Byrne defended his decision. As they played, Mr. Byrne could see  Mr. Buffett becoming agitated. On the ninth hole, he noticed Mr. Buffett gritting his teeth, the veins in his neck pulsing. Unleashing a furious swing that clipped the top of the ball and sent it dribbling about 14 feet, Mr. Buffett wheeled on Mr. Byrne in a rage. ''Only a fool would lend long at this point in time,'' Mr. Byrne recalls him shouting. ''Only a fool.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Byrne managed to stay on as chief executive. But he immediately hired a specialist to run his investment portfolio.</p>
        <p>Governance and Succession</p>
        <p>If Mr. Greenberg and Mr. Buffett run their companies like owners, it is not without a certain logic. Mr. Buffett owns more than 30 percent of Berkshire's stock; Mr. Greenberg owns 2.2 percent of A.I.G.'s, but he estimates that top management and the board control about 30 percent of the shares. And each is accorded complete authority as the builder of his enterprise.</p>
        <p>Of course, each man has aligned things in his favor. In defiance of the norms of governance for public companies, their boards are heavy with insiders. Neither man is interested in hearing about mandatory retirement; both say they plan to go on leading their companies indefinitely.</p>
        <p>Mr. Greenberg had to face a few hecklers on such issues at A.I.G.'s annual meeting in May. But their reward for speaking up was chilly glares from other shareholders and employees who had crowded into the modest company cafeteria. As Mr. Greenberg was detailing yet another stellar year and announcing yet another stock split, one protester rose to argue that earnings often suffer at companies with less-than-independent boards. Mr. Greenberg lobbed a soft reply: ''Are you sure you're in the right place?'' And the room, full of loyalists, chuckled and clucked.</p>
        <p>Professional financial analysts tend to melt before Mr. Buffett and Mr. Greenberg, too.</p>
        <p>At Berkshire's annual meetings in Omaha, reporters ask Mr. Buffett for autographs; instead of trying to poke holes in his strategies, many securities analysts admiringly quote Buffett aphorisms. When Mr. Greenberg invites insurance analysts once a year to what they refer to as a fireside chat, the questions are gentle. They have all heard the tales of how Mr. Greenberg has called analysts and read them -- and their bosses, who covet A.I.G.'s investment banking business -- the riot act.</p>
        <p>''You don't mess around with Hank,'' one analyst said on condition of anonymity. ''He could squash me like a bug.''</p>
        <p>It is no surprise that such a leader would have dynastic dreams, and Mr. Greenberg intends to keep the future of A.I.G. in the family. His eldest son, Jeffrey, had been regarded by A.I.G. watchers as the heir apparent, but he resigned abruptly five years ago, later becoming chief executive of Marsh &amp; McLennan, the giant insurance broker. Now Jeffrey's 45-year-old brother Evan, A.I.G.'s president, has been designated as next in line to run the company, where he has worked for 25 years.</p>
        <p>Apart from the confidence of his father, it is hard to tell, at this point, how well Evan Greenberg might perform. Subordinates earnestly describe his thoroughness and command of the nuances of the business. Some say he is brilliant. But industry executives who know him well are noncommittal.</p>
        <p>''As far as I know he's a competent fellow,'' said Barber B. Conable, a former congressman and past president of the World Bank who is one of six directors on A.I.G.'s 18-member board who are neither company executives nor contractors. ''This is not an issue we've been worrying about,'' he added, ''because Hank shows every sign of continuing as the leader.''</p>
        <p>In any event, Mr. Conable said, after the senior Mr. Greenberg dies, there is nothing to stop the board from choosing whomever it decides is best suited to run the company.  Mr. Conable said he once told Mr. Greenberg: ''You must understand, your son will be tested by the board at such time as you step down.''</p>
        <p>At Berkshire Hathaway, Mr. Buffett has installed a seven-member board that comprises his wife, Susan, who lives apart from him in San Francisco; his son, Howard G. Buffett; Charles T. Munger, the company's vice chairman, who has long been Mr. Buffett's confidant; a law partner of Mr. Munger's and two other longtime business associates of Mr. Buffett's.</p>
        <p>After Mr. Buffett dies, his wife is to receive nearly all his stock. But she will not run the company; instead, he has designated two Berkshire executives to take his place -- one to handle investments, the other operations. Neither has been publicly named, but there has been speculation that Louis A. Simpson, who is in charge of investments at Geico, would take over the investing side. Buffett watchers mention several candidates for the operations job, with little conviction.</p>
        <p>Whoever they are, Mr. Buffett's successors will be hard pressed to preserve Berkshire's unique place in the investment pantheon. The market does not value Berkshire as it would an insurance company, even though that is what it mainly is. Rather, it is priced largely on the performance of its chief executive's stock picks. Whether the cult followers will remain in thrall to Mr. Buffett's successors is anybody's guess.</p>
        <p>A.I.G. certainly revolves around Mr. Greenberg -- ''If you don't have a relationship with Hank Greenberg, you don't have a relationship with A.I.G.,'' said an insurance executive who has known Mr. Greenberg for years. But analysts say an A.I.G. without Mr. Greenberg is a surer bet than Berkshire without Mr. Buffett: There are more units, more decision makers, a broader playing field.</p>
        <p>Comparing the Scorecards</p>
        <p>In the meantime, neither Mr. Buffett nor Mr. Greenberg shows any sign of slowing down. Indeed, their  business strategies put them face to face more and more, inviting the comparisons that previously were not so obvious. For example, will Mr. Buffett's Geico or Mr. Greenberg's A.I.G. Direct reap the most rewards in the competition for bargain-minded auto insurance customers?</p>
        <p>Both are pouring money into advertising and expansion. Characteristically, Mr. Buffett is going for broke; he wants Geico to become one of the giants in the business. Mr. Greenberg wants to grow, too, but earnings in car insurance fluctuate too much to suit him, so he will keep the line from dominating A.I.G.'s portfolio of businesses.</p>
        <p>Ultimately, do you bet on the Manhattan tortoise or the Omaha hare? Ms. Schroeder, the Morgan Stanley analyst, finds it difficult to choose. ''That's like asking whether to buy a Van Gogh or a Monet,'' she says.</p>
        <p>From Rivalry to Cooperation</p>
        <p>AFTER decades of rubbing shoulders around the casino tables of finance, Warren E. Buffett and Maurice R. Greenberg have come to admire each other warmly.</p>
        <p>''The vibe between us is not competitors,'' Mr. Buffett said. ''The vibe between us is friends.'' Envious friends, but friends. ''I wish I had done some of the deals he's done,'' Mr. Buffett said, ''and maybe he wishes he'd done some of the deals I've done.''</p>
        <p>Indeed, Mr. Greenberg said, ''we have a great relationship.''</p>
        <p>But things have not always been so rosy. Fifteen years ago, they exchanged verbal punches. Mr. Buffett criticized the way the American International Group, of which Mr. Greenberg is chief executive, used reinsurance, and Mr. Greenberg fired back that Mr. Buffett had ''a peanut-sized book'' of insurance business -- which was true at the time -- and that he was a fine one to be telling him how to run his company, already a giant in the industry.</p>
        <p>But that was a long time ago. Now they are doing business together; A.I.G. is one of the biggest customers  of General Re, Mr. Buffett's main insurance holding. And they are keen competitors: TransAtlantic, the big reinsurer that A.I.G. controls, goes after some of the same business that  General Re does, and the two titans are pursuing the same customers in their car insurance businesses.</p>
        <p>They have collaborated on some joint projects, but their biggest idea -- the attempted rescue and takeover of Long Term Capital Management, the hedge fund that nearly failed in 1998 -- came to nothing. Others on Wall Street beat them to it.</p>
        <p>But they're still thinking. ''It's logical that we would team up on something,'' Mr. Buffett said. ''We and they have enormous capital resources.''</p>
