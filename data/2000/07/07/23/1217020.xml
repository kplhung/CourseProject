        <p>You work abstractly with sounds in your head on pieces you may never hear. The fruition of your art largely depends on others, for a cost you can barely afford. To make matters worse, no one is longing for your finished product -- indeed, your audience clings to masters of the past. You are a classical composer, swimming against the tide of popular culture.</p>
        <p>There are times, however, when it all seems worthwhile. For Binnette Lipper, a composer in White Plains, a highlight was the recent release of her first compact disc, ''Horizons.'' The recording of her chamber music by eight woodwind and string players, including four members of the New York Philharmonic, gives her something tangible to market in this most ephemeral of occupations.</p>

        <p>You work abstractly with sounds in your head on pieces you may never hear. The fruition of your art largely depends on others, for a cost you can barely afford. To make matters worse, no one is longing for your finished product -- indeed, your audience clings to masters of the past. You are a classical composer, swimming against the tide of popular culture.</p>
        <p>There are times, however, when it all seems worthwhile. For Binnette Lipper, a composer in White Plains, a highlight was the recent release of her first compact disc, ''Horizons.'' The recording of her chamber music by eight woodwind and string players, including four members of the New York Philharmonic, gives her something tangible to market in this most ephemeral of occupations.</p>
        <p>''I've had many, many performances all over the world,'' she said in a recent phone interview, ''but there has been nothing easy to circulate to make my music known.''</p>
        <p>The recording spanned two years as Ms. Lipper, a former piano teacher at Hoff-Barthelson Music School in Scarsdale who now serves on the school's board of directors, waited for the musicians' schedules to dovetail. Shortly before the first recording session, which was to take place in the recital hall of the Purchase College music building, there was disconcerting news. ''They were fixing the roof, but said it was O.K. for me to work there if I didn't mind some banging,'' she recalled. ''After losing my cool a bit, I was promised the big theater in the Performing Arts Center.''</p>
        <p>Greg Squires of Squires Production in Elmsford was the recording engineer, and his company helped with production. Ms. Lipper took the cover picture of misty mountain ranges while on vacation in Jordan. ''Horizons'' is available for $10.95 by calling (888) 859-9229, or checking the Web site www.musiciansshowcase.com.</p>
