        <p>The star German sprinter Erik Zabel finally crossed the finish line first in the Tour de France today, ending three years without a victory (three years and nine days, but who's counting besides him?). ''Whew,'' Zabel said with a broad smile.</p>
        <p>Zabel, who races for the Telekom team, has registered many successes since his last of seven Tour victories. Among them are triumphs in the esteemed Milan-San Remo classic in March, which he has won three times, and in the Amstel Gold Race classic in May, as well as the overall lead this year in the World Cup series of one-day races.</p>

        <p>The star German sprinter Erik Zabel finally crossed the finish line first in the Tour de France today, ending three years without a victory (three years and nine days, but who's counting besides him?). ''Whew,'' Zabel said with a broad smile.</p>
        <p>Zabel, who races for the Telekom team, has registered many successes since his last of seven Tour victories. Among them are triumphs in the esteemed Milan-San Remo classic in March, which he has won three times, and in the Amstel Gold Race classic in May, as well as the overall lead this year in the World Cup series of one-day races.</p>
        <p>Until this 20th of 21 stages today, he had 15 victories this year, a big number, but none in the Tour since 1997. After that he had 10 second places in the Tour, including two this year, and five thirds, three this year.</p>
        <p>Zabel won with a fine display of teamwork, getting strong leadouts from two teammates in the final few hundred meters and then powering his way to victory by half a bicycle wheel over Robbie McEwen, an Australian with Farm Frites, and Jeroen Blijlevens, a Dutchman with Polti. Bumped in the stretch, Blijlevens could only pound his handlebar once in frustration as he finished.</p>
        <p>Zabel was timed in 6 hours 14 minutes 13 seconds for the 158-mile (254.5-kilometer) ride from Belfort in eastern France to Troyes. Lance Armstrong maintained his unassailable overall lead of 6:02 over Zabel's teammate, Jan Ullrich.</p>
        <p>The length of this stage, one day before the finale in Paris, was denounced by many riders, who noted that this was the third stage over 150 miles in the last week.</p>
        <p>''Insane,'' Frankie Andreu said beforehand. He finished in 111th place, 2:43 behind, but was untroubled.</p>
        <p>Andreu did not ride for high placing today nor in the final individual time trial on Friday nor in the two breakaways he joined as the race made its way to the Pyrenees and Alps. That's not his job; he needs to save himself to work for Armstrong, the leader of their United States Postal Service team.</p>
        <p>''My job is to help the team,'' Andreu, 33, explained before the stage. ''We're here to get the yellow jersey, and I'm here to protect it.''</p>
        <p>Andreu is widely known as one of the most selfless and most durable team workers in the sport. When the race finishes on Sunday, Andreu will have completed his ninth Tour de France in nine appearances. Among the 128 riders left of the 177 who set out July 1, few can match his record.</p>
        <p>''A little bit is determination and just suffering through the hard parts,'' he said. ''A lot of it is luck, being able to stay out of crashes. You can't always control where you are, and sometimes things just happen.''</p>
        <p>When they do, he remounts and keeps going. As a team worker, Andreu gets few chances to ride for individual victory because he must remain near Armstrong, who has no need to contest a final sprint and no chance to jump into a breakaway.</p>
        <p>Even before Armstrong wore the leader's yellow jersey, Andreu was occupied by his duties of riding ahead of Armstrong and sheltering him from the wind or offering his wheel if the leader had a flat.</p>
        <p>''That first week, when Lance didn't have the jersey, our job was to keep him in the front and to keep him as rested as possible,'' Andreu said. Leaders try to stay at the front to avoid attacks and mass crashes.</p>
        <p>''This has been a hard Tour,'' Andreu said, ''partly because of the weather. It was so windy the first week, and that meant a lot of work to keep Lance in the front. And then, when he took the jersey'' -- on the 10th day -- ''there's a lot of energy that you don't realize you're expending trying to stay in the front and battle the wind. You're paying the price the last week.''</p>
        <p>That price is weariness. ''It's not the wind now,'' Andreu said Friday. ''Now it's the legs.''</p>
        <p>He worked hard in the mountains, where he does not shine. ''My job is to work before the climbs,'' he said, ''and then the first part of the climbs. I have to stay in the front for the first part of the climb until I blow.</p>
        <p>''Everybody's got a job and you've got to do what you've got to do -- save the climbers as long as possible so they can do their job.''</p>
        <p>Speaking of jobs, Andreu surprisingly reported that he had not yet been signed for a fourth year with the Postal Service team and a 13th year as a professional.</p>
        <p>''I'm unemployed right now,'' he said. ''So I'm looking. I'm still talking with Postal Service, and I've got to talk with some other teams.''</p>
        <p>Wherever he winds up, he agreed, if he returns to the Tour de France next year, he expects to work hard for his leader and attempt to stretch his own record of finishing the race.</p>
