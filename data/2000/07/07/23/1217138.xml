        <p>Somehow, it is hard to think about the Hamptons in this summer of excess without also thinking about F. Scott Fitzgerald's ''Great Gatsby.'' Though the novel is set in West Egg on a different shore of Long Island, Fitzgerald might as well have been describing the Hamptons in July and August -- ''a night scene by El Greco: a hundred houses, at once conventional and grotesque, crouching under a sullen, overhanging sky and a lusterless moon.'' Like West Egg, the South Fork of Long Island, once a potato patch, is now a land of tycoons and movie stars and models and the kind of people who attend publicity parties for perfumes and wristwatches.</p>
        <p>What runs through Fitzgerald's novel is the liquidity of money, crystallizing here and there in a mansion like Gatsby's, built by a brewer who ''agreed to pay five years' taxes on all the neighboring cottages if the owners would have their roofs thatched with straw.'' The irony has leaked out of that brewer's story, if only because it seems so possible in the Hamptons these days, where every new house is a mansion and every mansion is a fiefdom. What is missing from tales of modern, oceanside wealth is the surprise Nick Carraway feels when he learns that Tom Buchanan brought a string of polo ponies from Illinois to Long Island. ''It was hard to realize,'' he says, ''that a man in my own generation was wealthy enough to do that.'' These days, nothing could surprise us less.</p>

        <p>Somehow, it is hard to think about the Hamptons in this summer of excess without also thinking about F. Scott Fitzgerald's ''Great Gatsby.''

        <p>What runs through Fitzgerald's novel is the liquidity of money, crystallizing here and there in a mansion like Gatsby's, built by a brewer who ''agreed to pay five years' taxes on all the neighboring cottages if the owners would have their roofs thatched with straw.'' The irony has leaked out of that brewer's story, if only because it seems so possible in the Hamptons these days, where every new house is a mansion and every mansion is a fiefdom. What is missing from tales of modern, oceanside wealth is the surprise Nick Carraway feels when he learns that Tom Buchanan brought a string of polo ponies from Illinois to Long Island. ''It was hard to realize,'' he says, ''that a man in my own generation was wealthy enough to do that.'' These days, nothing could surprise us less.</p>
        <p>Fitzgerald captures not only the gulf that separates the rich from the unrich, but also the way the rich differ among themselves. It is not just a difference between new money and old, or, these days, between new money and abrupt money. It is a difference in expectation. To Gatsby, the green light burning at the end of Tom and Daisy Buchanan's dock across the bay epitomizes an ''incorruptible dream'' that only money can realize. To the Buchanans, who take money for granted and for whom every dream is corruptible, the green light merely marks where the water begins. But if someone put a green light at the end of his or her property in the Hamptons, the only thing it would mark is the beginning of a lawsuit.</p>
        <p>Wealth in ''The Great Gatsby'' always seems disorienting, strangely dislocating. And that is how the Hamptons have seemed for some 20 years to many New Yorkers. Every summer, there is a high tide of reporting on the doings out there -- the legal wrangling, the real-estate prices, the frenzied leisure of the super-rich -- mixed with wondering whether the Hamptons are finally over. But the Hamptons seem to exist for the pleasure of people who like looking at green lights from afar as well as for the pleasure of people who like having their green lights envied. To most of us, there is something almost soporific in the sound of millionaires whining at the edge of the ocean. It is the sound of summer, a sound as characteristic of the season as crickets keening in the high grass.</p>
