        <p>After harsh denunciations of Peru's recent presidential election, top Clinton administration officials say they do not have enough leverage to force a new vote and will work with President Alberto K. Fujimori while continuing to press for reform.</p>
        <p>With less than a week before Mr. Fujimori is to be sworn in for a third term after an election and campaign widely criticized for gross irregularities, administration officials say they will send the American ambassador in Lima, John Hamilton, to attend Mr. Fujimori's inauguration next Friday.</p>
        <p>Mr. Hamilton's presence will signal ''the reality'' that Mr. Fujimori ''is going to head the government of Peru at least for the foreseeable future, and we acknowledge that we have mutual, bilateral business to conduct,'' a senior administration official said.</p>
        <p>Critics in Congress and human rights groups say the softening of the American stance sets a troubling precedent in a hemisphere where several elected leaders have recently taken steps toward more authoritarian rule.</p>
        <p>Peru is perhaps the United States' best-performing ally in the fight against the illegal drug trade in the region, and administration officials  privately acknowledged that concerns about maintaining antinarcotics cooperation played a hand in their decision-making.</p>
        <p>They also attributed the shift to a number of other factors: resistance from key Latin American governments to tougher action; Mr. Fujimori's ample financial reserves, which would make sanctions less effective; and discomfort with the leader of Peru's opposition, Alejandro Toledo, whom they see as too weak and inexperienced to lead a successful drive to restore democracy in Peru.</p>
        <p>Congress eliminated $42 million in aid to Lima last month and the Senate approved a provision to cut off more funds for Peru if the president reports that Mr. Fujimori has failed to make ''substantial progress in improving its respect for human rights.'' But exemptions for counternarcotics and humanitarian help left the actual amount of aid at stake at less than $10 million.</p>
        <p>While American officials acknowledged having doubts that Mr. Fujimori is prepared to make key democratic reforms, they say that in the end they decided to follow the lead of the 34-nation Organization of American States, a consensus-driven group  that has called for negotiations with Mr. Fujimori and has ruled out more forceful action, like sanctions.</p>
        <p>In a scathing report on Peru's election, the group's own monitors denounced the harassment of opposition candidates, government control of the media, arrests of would-be voters and the mutilation of ballots in the first round. Mr. Toledo ultimately asked to have his name scratched from ballots in the May 28 runoff, charging he could not get a fair vote.</p>
        <p>But at the O.A.S. annual assembly last month in Canada, Mexico, Brazil and Venezuela steered the region toward negotiations with Mr. Fujimori, administration officials said. A high-level O.A.S. delegation then drew up proposals aimed at ''strengthening democracy'' under the current Peruvian government and appointed an envoy to monitor any progress.</p>
        <p>Administration officials said they  favored a call for new elections in Peru using the threat of multilateral economic sanctions as leverage.  ''There's a little bit of uncertainty as to how to proceed,'' said one State Department official. ''The U.S. was hoping the O.A.S. would take the ball and run with it.'' Instead, the official said, the O.A.S. ''has taken new elections off the table.''</p>
        <p>While withholding some aid to Peru could set back United States efforts to eradicate drug crops and disrupt trafficking, critics of the administration decision say the greater risk is tolerating stolen elections.</p>
        <p>''The risk here is sending a message to the rest of the hemisphere that if you cooperate with us on narcotics interdiction, everything else you do including the suppression of democracy is fine,'' said Representative Robert Menendez, a New Jersey Democrat.</p>
