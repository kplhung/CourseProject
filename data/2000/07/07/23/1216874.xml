        <p>PROLIFIC and unpredictable, Patrice Leconte is an anomalous figure in today's French cinema.</p>
        <p>His films -- including the deliriously romantic ''The Hairdresser's Husband'' (1990), the droll historical drama ''Ridicule,'' which was nominated for an Oscar in 1997, and ''The Girl on the Bridge,'' a poetic love story with Daniel Auteuil and Vanessa Paradis that opens on Friday in New York -- belong neither to the grossly commercial film industry nor to the French tradition of ''auteur'' filmmaking.</p>
        <p>Mr. Leconte has somehow managed to transcend those narrow categories, creating movies that have both broad, popular appeal and a distinctive personal signature, much like the great Hollywood filmmakers of the studio era.</p>
        <p>And like those studio filmmakers, he seems to be in almost constant motion. He has averaged one feature a year since his debut in 1975, and in the time it has taken for ''The Girl on the Bridge'' to reach the United States, he has completed one feature -- the period piece ''The Widow of Saint-Pierre,'' with Juliette Binoche and Daniel Auteuil -- and is well into the filming of another, ''Felix et Lola,'' with Charlotte Gainsbourg and Philippe Torreton. In his spare time, he makes television commercials.</p>
        <p>''After 'The Widow of Saint-Pierre,' I said to myself, I've worked a lot, I've worked well, and I want to stop a little. I want to breathe, to rest, to look at the clouds, to travel, I don't know what. I want to take a year or two, just to dream. And all of my friends and my family said, 'He'll never stop.' I said, 'You'll see.' Then I realized that even when a film is exhausting, when it weighs very heavily on your shoulders, you can still recover in a week or two. And I realized above all that what I liked most in the world was making movies. So I said, forget what I said. It's stupid to stop doing what you love to do.''</p>
        <p>A small, wiry man with close-cropped hair and large eyes framed by large, rose-tinted glasses, Mr. Leconte spoke on a recent Saturday morning in his office, a sun-filled former painter's studio here on the Boulevard du Montparnasse.</p>
        <p>''My origins are very simple,'' he said. ''I'm not Parisian. I lived in Provence. My father had nothing to do with the movies. He was a doctor. But he was a cinephile. Without doing it on purpose, he gave me his passion. I used his amateur camera to make little things in eight-millimeter. One fine day I said to my parents, I want to make movies. So in 1967 I went up to Paris and took film courses at what was then the national film school, I.D.H.E.C.''</p>
        <p>After making a number of short films, Mr. Leconte graduated to features with the comic thriller ''The Toilets Were Locked From the Inside,'' which found him in constant conflict with his more seasoned star, Jean Rochefort. ''It wasn't a very good film,'' Mr. Leconte said, ''and it was a commercial failure. But the second film, 'Les Bronzes,' was a huge hit.''</p>
        <p>''Les Bronzes'' (''The Tanned Ones'') represented the film debut of the members of the Splendid troupe, an improvisational cafe theater that was then the rage of Paris. The group included Michel Blanc, Thierry Lhermitte, Gerard Jugnot, Christian Clavier and Josiane Balasko -- all of whom have gone on to become stars in France.</p>
        <p>''Their story is amazing,'' Mr. Leconte said. ''They had all been in the same high school class, the same students in the same classroom. You realize? Afterward, they stayed together, they did the Splendid, and now they're all stars. In the same class, at 15 years old, there was Lhermitte, Clavier, Jugnot, Blanc -- it's unimaginable. I'll bet their teachers remember.''</p>
        <p>''Les Bronzes,'' based on a play the troupe had created, satirized a collection of average Frenchmen on vacation in a Club Med-style resort. Drawing on a sketch-style humor, it launched a new trend in French comedy, much as ''Saturday Night Live'' had in the United States, and generated a series of sequels (''Les Bronzes Go Skiing,'' 1979) and follow-ups (''Come to My Place, I Live at my Girlfriend's,'' 1980; ''Keep Moving, There's Nothing to See,'' 1982) that established Mr. Leconte as the foremost director of comedy in France.</p>
        <p>But he was restless. With ''The Specialists'' (1984), he tried a caper film; with ''Tandem'' (1986), a more naturalistic, sentimental comedy. But no one was prepared for ''Monsieur Hire'' when it had its premiere at the 1988 Cannes International Film Festival. A moody, perverse, passionate film about a mousy tailor (Mr. Blanc) who spies on his beautiful neighbor (Sandrine Bonnaire), the film was just as surprising as if John Belushi had suddenly (and successfully) taken up Dostoyevsky.</p>
        <p>'' 'Tandem' changed a lot of things for me,'' Mr. Leconte said. ''But 'Monsieur Hire' was, no doubt, the first real evident change in register, in style. When I made it, people asked me constantly if I'd changed -- what had changed in me to make something so different. But actually nothing had changed. This is the best comparison: you like the movies, you go often to the movies, but when you go, sometimes you see comedies, sometimes you see dramas or adventures -- you go to see everything, if you like the movies. And so, if when you're a spectator, you like a lot of different things, why can't you, as a director, make a lot of different things? It's all cinema.''</p>
        <p>From ''Monsieur Hire'' on, Mr. Leconte developed an adventurous, highly emotional style that broke many of the fundamental rules of the commercial cinema while continuing to function within it.</p>
        <p>''Monsieur Hire'' and ''The Hairdresser's Husband'' both take place in dreamlike worlds that seem to exist outside any particular time or locale; ''Ridicule'' bends the rules of the period film by introducing subtly disorienting, anachronistic touches; ''The Girl on the Bridge'' combines old-fashioned, classically lighted black-and-white images with a freedom of camera movement that shatters any sense of nostalgia.</p>
        <p>Just as the protagonists of ''Girl'' -- Mr. Auteuil plays a professional knife thrower and Ms. Paradis is the girl he saves from suicide to become his professional target -- can chat casually with each other across time and space, so do Mr. Leconte's films push to transcend specific epochs and physical settings. Like the American master Frank Borzage (''Seventh Heaven,'' 1927), Mr. Leconte believes in the power of emotion to rise above the petty limitations of reality. For him, love knows no boundaries.</p>
        <p>WHAT pleased me a lot about 'The Girl on the Bridge' was that it was a love story but that it was above all a story of desire,'' he said. ''The two characters feel that, above their heads, something very strong is hovering, and a spark would be enough to get them to fall in each other's arms. But this spark only comes at the very end. The challenge is to build that desire for an hour and a half, until at the end it finally happens.''</p>
        <p>''All films are love stories,'' said Mr. Leconte, and it is true that a powerful, almost swooning sense of romantic redemption runs through his best films. But he remains capable of following a romance like ''The Hairdresser's Husband'' with a black comedy like ''Tango'' (1992), or ''Ridicule'' with a big-star romp like ''One Chance Out of Two'' (1998) starring Alain Delon and Jean-Paul Belmondo (which was not released in the United States).</p>
        <p>For Mr. Leconte, changing registers is ''the only solution for me to stay alive, not to go to sleep, to frighten myself, to put myself in question, to never take the same road twice.'' He continued: ''I want to astonish myself. I want to do things that I don't know how to do. If you make the same film all your life, if you take the same route movie after movie, you're more likely to go around in circles. Me, when I go in one direction, then in another, then in another, I tell myself, well, I have less risk of repeating myself. The only cure for facileness is to be completely new each time. It works for me.</p>
        <p>''There's something in France that has done a lot of harm to the cinema, the notion of the 'cinema d'auteur.' You in the U.S. have a great advantage over us, because there the notion of auteur cinema doesn't really exist. There are writers and there are directors, and they aren't necessarily the same person. In France, if you make a film you haven't written, you don't get much respect. But I've always thought there aren't just directors who can write great stories -- there are screenwriters for that.</p>
        <p>''Writers aren't paid very well in France, and that's a problem. When I made 'Ridicule,' it was a script that was proposed to me. I loved it, and I said, 'We'll shoot this, we won't change a comma, it's magnificent.' But before they offered it to me, the producers had offered it to four other directors, big people, and they all said, 'No thanks, I only shoot what I write.' And they said no to a very good script. It's idiotic.</p>
        <p>''The author is also the director, of course. If you give a good script to three different directors, you'll have three different films. It's the director plus the writer plus the actor plus the producer -- it takes the whole thing, you have to be many, you have to be surrounded by people with lots of talent and you have to have a little bit yourself.</p>
        <p>''For 'The Girl on the Bridge,' I didn't write the script. The scenarist, Serge Frydman, is a young guy in his 40's who likes writing scripts. He doesn't want to be a director; he's a screenwriter. The two of us together, drinking a lot of coffee, invented the story of 'The Girl,' but I never picked up a pen to write anything. Afterward, I said, 'O.K., we've talked enough about it, go write it.' And he wrote it by himself. When you shoot a film you haven't written, you have a much more objective point of view. You want to make a movie worthy of the screenplay, and I find that very motivating.''</p>
        <p>''I don't aspire to be good at everything,'' Mr. Leconte concluded. ''But I do aspire to stay awake.''</p>
