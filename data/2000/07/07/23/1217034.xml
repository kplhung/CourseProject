        <p>Musician Tom Chapin, younger brother of late folk singer Harry Chapin, is set to perform free two-part concert, one for adults and one for children, at Bucleuch Park Concert Lawn in New Brunswick, NJ (S)</p>

        <p>Tom Chapin is a rare breed. He is a children's music artist who doesn't scare off parents, and actually raises the bar for children. The younger brother of the late folk singer Harry Chapin, Tom is an accomplished musician on his own. Performing with his band, the amiable Mr. Chapin, offers up a sweet mix of folk-based music in a two part concert -- one for the adults, and the other for younger listeners, who have most likely grown up listening to his clever, educational, entertaining and thought-provoking music. The host of the television series ''Make A Wish'' will perform favorites from his children's recordings like ''Family Tree'' and ''Mother Earth, as well as his soon-to-be-released grown-up folk-rock album, ''In the City of Mercy.'' Children will have a blast singing ''There are two kinds of seagulls, shegulls and hegulls,'' as well as other Chapin hits like ''Picnic of the World'' (get ready to reel off those nations), and ''Stone Soup.'' Mr. Chapin offers up a free evening of family entertainment -- devoid of silly purple dinosaurs, La-La's and Po's -- on Thursday at 7:30 p.m. on the Buccleuch Park Concert Lawn in New Brunswick.</p>
