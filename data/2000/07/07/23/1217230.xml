        <p>When Walter F. Mondale tapped Geraldine Ferraro as his running mate in 1984, he was so far behind that he felt, as he put it the other day, he had to ''reshuffle the deck because the economy was good and Reagan was popular.''</p>
        <p>When George Bush turned to Dan Quayle in 1988, his media adviser, Roger Ailes, hoped that the young senator would have such sex appeal that women might try to tear at his clothes.</p>
        <p>And when Bob Dole settled on an old foe, Jack Kemp, four years ago, a crucial consideration was that it would be a surprise. Scott Reed, the Dole campaign manager, said his boss had not worried about how they would click in the White House. ''It was all about winning the election,'' Mr. Reed said. ''I had confidence that the compatibility issue could be worked out later.''</p>
        <p>But this time, advisers to Gov. George W. Bush of Texas say he seems to be steering clear of the glamour and gloss -- and more toward the safe and solid.</p>
        <p>As Mr. Bush secludes himself at his Texas ranch this weekend to make up his mind on his most momentous campaign decision so far, a leading choice, his advisers say, is Richard B. Cheney.</p>
        <p>Mr. Cheney is a respected but hardly electrifying former defense secretary and former congressman who is orchestrating the search for a running mate.</p>
        <p>Another candidate who has surfaced in recent days is Senator John Danforth, who initially had taken himself out of the running. [Page 18.] Mr. Danforth is known more for steadiness than star quality, as are two governors who apparently survived to the homestretch: Frank Keating of Oklahoma and George E. Pataki of New York.</p>
        <p>It could be, of course, that Mr. Bush is using the speculation over Mr. Cheney as a distraction while he readies his true decision -- and has a colossal surprise in mind. Maybe (with help from his father) he can persuade Gen. Colin L. Powell after all. Maybe there is even a mystery selection.</p>
        <p>But Bush advisers and friends of General Powell insist that he is not interested, leaving the focus on Mr. Cheney and others.</p>
        <p>''Cheney is the C.P.A. choice,'' one prominent Republican strategist said. ''Competent. Quiet. And dull.''</p>
        <p>That may be by design. Mr. Bush's advisers say the governor is so confident he will win that he is focused less on bald electoral calculations for Nov. 7 -- like whether his running mate would make a state more competitive -- and more on whom he wants beside him on Jan. 20, when he expects to be sworn in as the next president.</p>
        <p>The announcement of Mr. Bush's choice is not expected before Tuesday.</p>
        <p>Another reason Mr. Bush appears less concerned about a No. 2 with pizazz is his recognition that, thanks to Bill Clinton, the role of the vice president has broadened. In picking Al Gore, Mr. Clinton made the vice presidency more than an understudy's job. It is now one that voters expect to be filled with a person of substance.</p>
        <p>''It used to be thought that vice-presidential nominations were decided on the basis of a hunch or right off the top of the head,'' said Mr. Danforth, who is known for his rectitude, not his personality. ''Nowadays, it's a much more serious thing. The role of the vice presidency has changed. It's not just the cipher job that it used to be.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Danforth said that months ago, he submitted a box of background material at the campaign's request. He said he would never volunteer to be the running mate but would take the job ''if push came to shove.''</p>
        <p>But Mr. Danforth said Mr. Cheney would make ''a terrific choice'' because he has the credentials and temperament to function well in the White House. Asked about another possibility, Senator John McCain, Mr. Danforth alluded to lingering strains from the bitterly contested primaries.</p>
        <p>''A president has to pick somebody he likes and is very, very comfortable with,'' Mr. Danforth said. ''Or else, the vice president is going to be stashed in a closet somewhere. It would be a reversion to the previous idea of what a vice president is.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Bush himself made clear this week that he was looking beyond Election Day.  ''There's been the time in the past where people, competent people, said, 'Well, let's just pick the vice president. Don't worry, we'll dump him once we get elected,' '' Mr. Bush said on CNN's ''Larry King Live.''</p>
        <p>''In other words,'' he added, ''use the person just for the election vehicle. I'm not going to do that.''</p>
        <p>Still, a choice that does not appear to be baldly political -- unlike picking Gov. Tom Ridge of Pennsylvania so he could deliver his state's 23 electoral votes -- may have more appeal among voters.</p>
        <p>Mr. Bush may be moving toward a less flashy choice because there are only so many flashy possibilities. Several advisers agreed that there was only one marquee candidate who would add value to the ticket -- General Powell -- and that Mr. Bush would snap him up if he thought General Powell was interested. Many advisers said Senator McCain would also enliven the ticket, but they questioned how well Mr. Bush would tolerate Mr. McCain only 18 steps from the back door of the Oval Office. Some Bush friends also said the governor would cringe at the perception that he was forced to turn to Mr. McCain to assure victory.</p>
        <p>''McCain would add the most oomph to the ticket,'' said Senator Arlen Specter, a Pennsylvania Republican.</p>
        <p>Kellyanne Fitzpatrick, a Republican pollster, agreed, saying Mr. McCain accomplished something few other Republicans have: ''He is such an incredible choice that he's even had people in Hollywood give him money.'' But she said ''an unexciting choice'' like Mr. Keating or Mr. Cheney would be safe because ''we know in the end people decide whom to vote for based on the top of the ticket rather than the middle.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Kemp suggested that if Mr. Bush were able to get General Powell, that might not be a panacea. ''The fact that he doesn't want it,'' he said, ''makes them want him even more.''</p>
        <p>General Powell aside, for every prospect, the downside seems to cancel out the upside.</p>
        <p>If Mr. Bush picked Mr. Cheney, he would win plaudits from Republicans who think Mr. Cheney would bring dignity, weight and foreign policy skills to the ticket. And while he has a solidly conservative voting record in Congress, Mr. Cheney has always worked well with moderates.</p>
        <p>Since 1995, Mr. Cheney has headed Halliburton, an energy services and construction company. He served as President Gerald R. Ford's chief of staff, then was a congressman from 1979-1989. He then was President Bush's defense secretary, where he was a major figure in the Persian Gulf war.</p>
        <p>''He's a big leaguer,'' said Senator Mitch McConnell, a Kentucky Republican who has pressed for Mr. Cheney. ''No one would say, 'I can't see this guy as president.' ''</p>
        <p>Others warned that Mr. Cheney, 59, is from a small state, Wyoming, that is already a safe bet for Mr. Bush to win. And, they said, he is risky because of his health: he has had three heart attacks.</p>
        <p>If he picks Mr. Keating, Mr. Bush would win raves from Republicans who admire Mr. Keating's handling of the Oklahoma City bombing and his credentials as a former prosecutor. Another plus is that he is Roman Catholic, and Mr. Bush has been trying to reassure Catholics after opponents suggested he was anti-Catholic. Others warn that he is from a state that is safely Republican and that his conservative background would not broaden the ticket.</p>
        <p>The selection of Mr. McCain would energize moderates and independents. But many conservatives warn they would not abide such a selection -- and would denounce Mr. McCain when the Republican convention opened in Philadelphia in a week.</p>
        <p>''There are a lot of problems,'' said David Keene, chairman of the American Conservative Union. ''A lot of conservatives would be very upset. It's hard to see him as a loyal team player who would not be trying to upstage everybody.''</p>
        <p>There are pros and cons to the other prospects. Governor Ridge, for one, has a riveting rags-to-respectability biography and could help carry his battleground state. But some conservatives would deride his abortion rights stand. Senator Chuck Hagel of Nebraska has a compelling military record and he has the foreign policy expertise that Mr. Bush lacks. But he is relatively green on the national stage.</p>
        <p>Mr. Pataki hails from a big state, but not even his own advisers predict that he could deliver it to the Republicans. A seemingly trivial factor is that Mr. Pataki stands about a half-foot taller than Mr. Bush, and nominees never like being overshadowed.</p>
        <p>Another possibility is Representative John Kasich of Ohio, who would bring vitality and a knowledge of Congress. But he has what some Bush advisers say is the Quayle problem: he exudes youthfulness -- and seems to lack gravitas.</p>
        <p>One who clearly has star quality is Senator Fred Thompson of Tennessee. He was a movie actor, after all. But some Bush advisers express concern that as a single man, Mr. Thompson would not project the appropriate family image.</p>
        <p>The new imperatives for a running mate have made the selection process complicated, if not confounding. Mr. Bush, and Mr. Gore, face often conflicting pressures: they want running mates who can be effective on the stump and in governing. They want someone who can excite party members but also attract independents.</p>
        <p>They also want drama. But they have to be mindful that reaching for the spectacular can be like a blind date with history. The result can be fresh and intoxicating -- like Mr. Gore eight years ago -- or disastrous.</p>
        <p>When Mr. Mondale picked Ms. Ferraro, he thought she would be an instant draw for women. He was wrong. Four years later, the elder Bush thought voters would find Mr. Quayle fresh and exciting. They did not, but the ticket won anyway.</p>
        <p>The selection of Quayle did carry shock value. He was so little known, even by Mr. Bush's own aides, that in New Orleans, the convention site, they busily photocopied his biography in the Almanac of American Politics so they could brief reporters on him.</p>
        <p>Governor Bush's aides said their candidate has learned from his father's experience that he need not be fixated on springing a surprise (though he does like surprises) and that, more important, the campaign has to be well prepared before announcing the choice. Mr. Bush also learned a lesson from watching his father serve as Ronald Reagan's No. 2 for eight years: he wants someone who is as faithful to him as his father was to Mr. Reagan but who also offers sound advice and does not stir the pot.</p>
        <p>It used to be so much simpler -- and swifter. In 1976, President Ford began his deliberations in earnest only hours before his No. 2 was announced. ''The meeting to decide on the nominee didn't begin until 3:15 a.m.,'' Mr. Ford wrote in his memoirs, ''A Time to Heal.'' Among those in the room was his chief of staff who would resurface decades later in vice-presidential politics: Dick Cheney.</p>
