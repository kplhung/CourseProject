        <p>To the Editor:</p>
        <p>I could not agree more with Anthony Tommasini's conclusion that ''the dogma of the 12-tone composers'' had, on balance, a ''hurtful impact on American composers, especially young ones.'' But when he cites a study that shows that 12-tone composers were a distinct minority during the 1950's and 60's, he significantly minimizes their impact, not so much on critics and musicians but on the long-suffering audiences who had to sit through this stuff. I was one of the sufferers, and I can tell you that even though these composers may have been in the minority, their music was performed far out of proportion to their numbers.</p>

        <p>And I have to disagree with Mr. Tommasini when he says that ''12-tone technique remains a vital and valid resource for composers today.'' I've had many years to listen to and attempt to like 12-tone music as an average music lover, and I've come to the conclusion that there is simply nothing to love about this technique. And the general lack of audience enthusiasm for this music tells me that I am not alone in my opinion.</p>
