        <p>A DOUBLE LIFE</p>
        <p>By Frederic Raphael.</p>
        <p>Catbird, $24.</p>
        <p>Frederic Raphael's new novel is as serviceable, and as forgettable, as its title. Indeed, the book's narrator, Guy de Roumegouse, does lead a double life. He is a French diplomat -- he has married twice, and is the father of two sons -- who is a repressed homosexual. ''Have I given the impression that I am a man without genuine human warmth and that I am trying to excuse my lack of ordinary affection? The truth is that I am in many ways, so far as I can judge, an affectionate father and, in the right circumstances, a considerate lover.'' This is the language of a man full of his own erudition, but it's erudition laced with self-loathing, and this goes on for nearly 400 pages. The repressed homosexual theme is not new ground for tilling; Thomas Mann mined it more effectively nearly 90 years ago in ''Death in Venice.'' Here, the old diplomat reflects on his youth in occupied France under the Vichy government; while active in the Resistance, he resisted his own sexual impulses, setting into motion events that lead inexorably to his downfall by the novel's end. Raphael's novel drones on and on like some distinguished old windbag uncle.</p>
