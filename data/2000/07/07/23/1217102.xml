        <p>AVRA  *  [Rating: One Star]  (212) 759-8550; 141 East 48th Street, between Third and Lexington Avenues; $$$; smoking section; all major credit cards.</p>
        <p>Avra offers a fish tour just after the aperitifs, which makes for a highly entertaining and educational five minutes. The seafood counter at this Greek restaurant is an eye-pleasing panorama, offering about a dozen fish listed on the menu. Appetizers include carp roe mousse with fresh lemon juice and red onion; spicy feta cheese spread with sauteed sweet red pepper and olive oil; and oven-baked giant Greek lima beans. Entrees include Atlantic salmon wrapped in grape leaves with baked orzo; souvlaki of grilled swordfish with tomato and peppers; and oven-baked Chilean sea bass with Vidalia onions, tomato and herbs. Also on the menu is lamb loin chops with lemon Avra potatoes and okra and grilled dry aged sirloin steak with feta-stuffed tomato and charred onions. (Review: 4/19/00)</p>

        <p>DIWAN GRILL  +++  (212) 593-5425; 148 East 48th Street, between Lexington and Third Avenues; $$; smoking at the bar; all major credit cards.</p>
        <p>This sedate midtown Indian restaurant is easy to overlook, but it is worth seeking out. The menu is standard New York Indian, heavy on the tandoor, but almost everything is well prepared and lively. Appetizers include tandoor-roasted shrimp; katori chat, which is phyllo cup potatoes, tomatoes, tamarind and mint sauce; and a mixed grill of chicken malai kebab, lambseekh kebab, shrimp and tandoor chicken. Entrees include skewered minced lamb kebabs, flavored with mild cheese; shrimp, lamb or chicken prepared in a vindaloo sauce, which is a very hot coconut and red pepper curry sauce; lamb korma, with cashews and saffron flavored sauce; and chicken tikka masala.

        <p>Hatsuhana is a comfortable and welcoming restaurant where you can depend on being served high-quality sushi whether you speak Japanese or not. Appetizers include white fish, shimeji mushrooms, clams and black olives flame broiled in olive oil; lobster wrapped in corn with a creamy lobster sauce; and slices of duck with scallions. Entrees include grilled Norwegian salmon with teriyaki sauce and vegetables; assortment of shrimp and vegetables fried in soybean oil; and a full-course dinner with oshitashi, sashimi, lobster-corn, tempura and sushi.

        <p>Marichu serves unusual Basque dishes in a location near the United Nations, frequently drawing a crowd of diplomats.
