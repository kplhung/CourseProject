        <p>HIKING some western trails of Harriman State Park will be easier because of the work of eight high school volunteers who are repairing damage from Hurricane Floyd and restoring trails in a section of the park near Tuxedo Park.</p>
        <p>The volunteers are part of a summer program of the Student Conservation Association, a nonprofit conservation group that places more than 2,500 high school students in summer conservation programs around the country, including 100 trail crews. The students, who pay their own transportation, will be working the trails for a month while camping nearby. Two staff leaders work with them.</p>

        <p>Ben Taylor of Tennessee and Angela Busby of Minnesota nailed spikes to a bridge they were building, and Sarah Charlop-Powers, at left above, a crew leader, helped them position the next plank. Farther down the trail, a raised section was being built through a boggy area. Jean Baptiste Dalle, far left, of France and Matthew Philley of Virginia struggled with a boulder.</p>
