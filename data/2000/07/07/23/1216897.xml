        <p>To the Editor: In close to 80 years of flying I have had many memorable experiences, from traveling at the fantastic speed of 65 miles an hour in an open cockpit in 1923 to enjoying the next-to-last flight of the Hindenburg. I noted that the word steerage was used in Jerome Priest's letter to the editor (June 25). I wonder how many readers remember that steerage referred to the cabins on the trans-Atlantic liners that were in the back of the ship over the propellers and rudder.</p>

        <p>I particularly enjoyed ''Bedding Down at 35,000 Feet.'' I seriously doubt the airlines will ever be able to match my flight on the Pan American Clipper in 1939. We went by train to Le Bourget. The next day we flew to the Azores to spend the night. The next day we flew at a low altitude to New York. I stayed on board and had my breakfast served in bed.</p>
