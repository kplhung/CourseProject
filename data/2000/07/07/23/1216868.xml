        <p>THE Jesuit Center here stands in a lush, rolling, Gainsborough-like landscape some seven miles west of Reading. Opened in 1930 as a novitiate, the imposing, slightly incongruous red brick building now serves as a Jesuit retirement home. As in most small, contained communities, the residents are not accustomed to seeing strangers. When the elderly priests look up from their dinners to watch the Rev. J. A. Panuska, who directs the Jesuit residence, lead a visitor into the refectory, they already know what has brought the outsider here.</p>
        <p>''You're here for the Tintoretto,'' says an unshaven priest leaning on a cane. The stranger nods. ''It stinks,'' the cleric says. ''The scripture tells how Jesus was repulsed by Lazarus's rotting flesh, how Jesus withdrew before the sight of death. The passage foreshadows his own death, and his triumph over death. And here Tintoretto gives us a milky white Lazarus, a muscular movie star whose nudity is covered by a paltry little cloth. He got it all wrong. All wrong.''</p>
        <p>The painting under discussion is ''The Raising of Lazarus,'' one of seven existing Tintoretto treatments of the subject. In 1998, the 42-by-58-inch oil painting was rediscovered during a general inventory at the Wernersville residence. At the time, it was hanging, unlighted and unlabeled, in a first-floor corridor across from the chapel entrance.</p>
        <p>''I remember when they came from the museum to examine it with their special lighting,'' said Father Panuska, who was a novice at the residence from 1948 through 1950 and has been the superior since 1998. He also recalls seeing the Tintoretto over the entrance to the third-floor library during his novitiate. ''I said, 'Oh my Lord, what is this that we have?' ''</p>
        <p>Jacopo Robusti Tintoretto (1518-94) was one of the great painters of the late Italian Renaissance. ''The Raising of Lazarus'' is a staged tableau done primarily in soft reds, pinks and flesh tones. In it, a placid Jesus resuscitates a nude, athletic-looking Lazarus. Mary and Martha, Lazarus's sisters, and a third witness kneel rapt and spellbound before Jesus, their heads pitched to the right in a gesture of adoration.</p>
        <p>Behind them, five additional witnesses, their faces concealed behind handkerchiefs or rendered in hidden profile, stand in an almost conspiratorial huddle beneath the now blackened leaves of an olive tree. An idealized view of Jerusalem from the hills of Bethany in the upper left section of the painting completes the composition.</p>
        <p>There is little doubt about the painting's authenticity. ''The Raising of Lazarus'' is listed in Rodolfo Pallucchino's 1982 Tintoretto catalog, the most authoritative source on the Venetian artist. The entry lists it as ''missing.'' Sarah Lidsey, the old-master specialist at Christie's in New York, expressed no doubt about the painting's authenticity after she was invited to inspect it last year. Tentatively dated 1556-57, ''The Raising of Lazarus'' is an early Tintoretto in excellent condition. Franco Mormando, a Jesuit and professor of Italian literature at Boston College who did extensive archival research on the painting, said it was probably commissioned as an ex-voto during a minor outbreak of the plague in Venice.</p>
        <p>From an art-historical standpoint, the discovery of the Tintoretto in Wernersville is not quite as significant as the discovery of Caravaggio's ''Taking of Christ'' in a Jesuit residence in Dublin in 1990. Yet the story of the Tintoretto painting is intriguing and involves several figures of ecclesiastical and historical prominence.</p>
        <p>The earliest document that mentions ''The Raising of Lazarus'' places the painting in Nottingham, England, in 1872. It subsequently traveled to Munich, Berlin and then to Rome, where Nicholas and Genevieve Brady, a pair of wealthy and devout American Roman Catholics, saw the work in the collection of Pietro Galleazzi. Galleazzi was a close confidant and aide to Cardinal Eugenio Pacelli, who served as papal nuncio in Berlin in the second decade of the 20th century and later became Pope Pius XII.</p>
        <p>''The Bradys spent their winters in Rome,'' Mr. Mormando said. ''They were part of that elite social ecclesiastical circle that would meet frequently in Rome and at the Vatican.''</p>
        <p>In 1928, Nicholas Brady purchased the Tintoretto from Galleazzi for $35,000, a high price for an artwork at that time. The bill of sale was witnessed by Frank Spellman, a young priest from Whitman, Mass., who had fallen out of favor with his local archdiocese and gone to test the ecclesiastical waters in Rome. He would later become Cardinal Francis Spellman, archbishop of New York.</p>
        <p>Brady, who had expanded a considerable family fortune through utility-company mergers, died in 1930. That same year, his wife donated the Tintoretto and 94 other artworks to the newly opened Wernersville novitiate, which had been paid for entirely by Brady at a cost of more than a million dollars.</p>
        <p>The Bradys were not collectors; they purchased the artworks as objects of contemplation for the novices and teachers at the novitiate. Their gift was of uneven quality. It included a miniature watercolor copy of Pinturicchio's Madonna and Child fresco in the Vatican and a small oil copy of Luca Signorelli's ''Overthrow of the Anti-Christ'' in the Duomo at Orvieto, along with several religious paintings by unknown 19th- and 20th-century painters and portraits of the Bradys. There was also a splendid Arts and Crafts Movement needlepoint series depicting the stations of the cross by Lilly Yeats (sister of the poet W. B. Yeats), several medieval ivory statues and a terra cotta angel head attributed to the school of Luca della Robbia. Still, the Tintoretto is the only work of real note.</p>
        <p>''The Raising of Lazarus'' hung in the Jesuit Center from 1930 onward, first in the upstairs library and then in a corridor outside the main chapel. ''I believe that the Jesuits simply forgot about it,'' Mr. Mormando said. ''Or that they thought the attribution was a sort of wishful thinking.''</p>
        <p>Since last December, just after the discovery of the painting became public, it has hung in the European gallery on the third floor of the Reading Public Museum and Art Gallery. The museum was founded in 1904 in the classroom of Dr. Levi Mengel, a Reading educator and explorer who participated in Admiral Perry's 1891 expedition to the Antarctic. Its core collection consists of 1,700 natural-history specimens that Dr. Mengel acquired for his classroom at the 1903 St. Louis World Exposition. On the second floor of the museum, a life-size plastic replica of Dr. Mengel inspecting a butterfly through a magnifying lens sits behind his desk, surrounded by specimen bottles and neatly organized wooden cabinets.</p>
        <p>Before the arrival of the Tintoretto, the museum's top attractions were the armor of a Samurai warrior, three shrunken heads from the Jivaro people of Ecuador, a mummified Egyptian female from 550 B.C. and, upstairs, a large 19th-century landscape painting by Julien Dupre titled ''The Balloon.''</p>
        <p>''We really have nothing of this quality in the entire museum,'' Robert Metzger, the director, says of the Tintoretto. ''We have some great masterpieces from several periods. But having a work from one of the great masters of the Italian Renaissance is of tremendous importance to us. We are very fortunate that the Jesuit center saw fit to loan it to us.''</p>
        <p>The Tintoretto has attracted visitors from New York, the West Coast and Europe. Father Panuska and Mr. Mormando are currently examining proposals from conservators for a minor restoration. After the conservation, the painting will travel selectively for several years. Although ''The Raising of Lazarus'' has been valued as high as $2 million -- a smaller version of the same subject by Tintoretto sold at Sotheby's for $950,000 in 1994 -- the Jesuits have no intention of selling it. ''My philosophy is that if something is given to an institution, they should use it for that purpose,'' Father Panuska said.</p>
        <p>''That purpose now is sharing this beautiful painting with the world, and with our local community,'' he continued. ''I'd like for this museum to be its home base. Then I would like to see it travel, but to smaller museums, perhaps near other Jesuit communities, where it would really be something special. So many museums are so gifted with wonderful paintings. I'd like this painting to travel to places where people would want to come and look at it.''</p>
