        <p>DEAR DIARY:</p>
        <p>It was a beautiful Saturday, so we decided to drive down the shore.</p>
        <p>After sailing through two toll booths on the Garden State Parkway with our E-ZPass tags, traffic began to pile up. Not wanting to sit in traffic, we quickly changed our plans.</p>
        <p>As we left the parkway, my husband said, ''We just wasted 50 cents,'' to which I replied, ''Yes, but we saved two quarters.''</p>
        <p>MARILYN COHEN VASEN</p>
        <p>Go figure. The following help-wanted ad for someone to mow lawns appeared in The Town Topics in Princeton recently: '' . . . Must know visual difference between grass. flowers, trees and shrubs.''</p>
        <p>RUTH B. ROUFBERG</p>
        <p>File this under diversity.</p>
        <p>Seen on Route 23, Pompton Road, was the following: ''Today's Special:  Chinese Smorgasbord.''</p>
        <p>MARIKO LOCKHART</p>
        <p>Staring me in the face the other morning on New Jersey Transit's Midtown Direct -- which runs between New York's Pennsylvania Station and Dover -- were two large posters with a picture of Governor Whitman and the words: ''New Jersey Welcomes The Republican National Convention.''</p>
        <p>I could have sworn the convention was being held in Philadelphia this year. Well, at least she wasn't shown frisking anyone .</p>
        <p>MITCHELL L. BLUMENTHAL</p>
        <p>It was the dinner hour when our train pulled into the Denville station. Two 30-something women were discussing their weekend plans.</p>
        <p>First woman: ''I made an appointment for a hair-coloring but I can't decide -- strawberry blonde, honey blonde, butterscotch blonde. Or maybe I'll go darker -- caramel brown, chocolate brown . . .''</p>
        <p>Second woman: ''Sweetie, you're hungry. You need a restaurant, not a hairdresser.''</p>
        <p>AUDREY CORN</p>
        <p>Summer camp can be every child's delight and every parent's dream. But if you have a large family, the dream can be a financial nightmare. While discussing our summer plans with a friend, she asked what camps I had chosen for my children.</p>
        <p>''With the cost of enrolling dfive children for the summer,'' I answered, ''I'd be better off securing a house down the shore.''</p>
        <p>''True,'' she said. ''But instead of them riding the waves, you could be doing the wave.''</p>
        <p>Hello, summer camp.</p>
        <p>DEIRDRE FLANAGAN WARD</p>
        <p>Newark International Airport, about 2 a.m., when a cabbie should be happy to get some business. And a bleary eyed family of four -- parents and a child maybe a year old and another maybe 3 -- looking desparate to get home.</p>
        <p>But first there was the luggage. A  cart loaded with three large suitcases and three or four smaller bags. The man of the family began loading them into the trunk. The cab driver shooed him off, took the luggage out and repacked it, though it was doubtful the trunk would close. Then came four or five more bags. Bags out, bags back in, even more mountainous. Then the woman presented two car seats, insisting the children must be strapped in their seats, along with more bags.</p>
        <p>The driver looked at the seats, looked at the parents, looked at his trunk. Without saying a word, he yanked the luggage out of the trunk, out of the seat, and put it all on the curb. Off he drove, empty cab, presumably in search of a single traveler bearing only a briefcase and a toothbrush.</p>
