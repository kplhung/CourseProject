        <p>The political elite of Washington and Georgia paid tribute here today to Senator Paul Coverdell as an ordinary man with extraordinary people skills and political talents who got things done.</p>
        <p>Mr. Coverdell, who died Tuesday at age 61, was a quietly influential member of the Republican leadership. An ally and friend of President George Bush, Mr. Coverdell was the chief liaison in the Senate to the presidential campaign of Mr. Bush's son, Gov. George W. Bush of Texas.</p>
        <p>Today, Governor Bush and more than 50 senators and representatives from both parties -- including Senators Trent Lott of Mississippi, the majority leader, and Edward M. Kennedy, Democrat of Massachusetts -- joined 900 other mourners in an emotional memorial to a man who defied the bitter political partisanship that grips the Capitol today. President Bush did not attend, but his tribute was read by a family friend of the Coverdells in the packed Peachtree United Methodist Church in the fashionable Buckhead section of town.</p>
        <p>''He loved politics and was a clear example of politics being a noble calling,'' President Bush wrote. ''He leaves behind a legacy that quiet is good, caring about the other guy matters.''</p>
        <p>On a day of celebrating Mr. Coverdell's life, even the fevered pitch of the presidential campaign was temporarily laid aside. Before and after the service, Governor Bush declined to comment on reports that Richard B. Cheney, the former secretary of defense, had risen to the top of his list of potential running mates.</p>
        <p>Lawmakers attending the service, including other Republican vice presidential candidates like Fred Thompson of Tennessee and John McCain of Arizona, were whisked to waiting cars or buses. But one Senate Republican, Mike DeWine of Ohio, said a Bush-Cheney ticket this fall would be a winning combination.  ''Dick Cheney has got what it takes,'' Mr. DeWine said.</p>
        <p>Most of the legislators and other family members and friends of Mr. Coverdell here today declined to talk politics, focusing instead on the unpretentious former backbencher in the Georgia State Senate who rose to the fourth-ranking position in the Senate Republican hierarchy.</p>
        <p>Clyde Rodbell, an Atlanta businessman and longtime friend of Mr. Coverdell, recalled that the senator hated anyone making a fuss over him, and took umbrage that his job might earn him favors from constituents or anyone else.</p>
        <p>Inside and outside the church, former colleagues remembered a self-effacing man and tireless worker who pushed for issues he believed in, from education vouchers to aid to help Colombia fight drug traffickers, without caring who received the credit.</p>
        <p>''He was sweet, selfless, loyal, caring, courageous, and -- incredibly for a United States Senator -- humble,'' Senator Phil Gramm, a Texas Republican, said in his eulogy. Mr. Coverdell's efforts to help get things done crossed partisan lines. Gov. Roy Barnes of Georgia, a Democrat, said that when he joined the Georgia State Senate as a 26-year-old legislator, Mr. Coverdell took him under his political wing, even though he was the leader of the chamber's Republicans. It was a friendship that lasted more a quarter-century, with the two men having breakfast regularly, Mr. Barnes said.</p>
        <p>''He showed that people of different parties could discuss their personal strengths and weaknesses,'' Mr. Barnes said, his voice catching while giving his eulogy. ''I never worried that Paul would disclose anything I said.''</p>
        <p>Under Georgia law, Mr. Barnes has the authority to appoint an interim successor to Mr. Coverdell's Senate seat until a special election is held on Nov. 7. He is expected to announce his choice in the next few days.</p>
