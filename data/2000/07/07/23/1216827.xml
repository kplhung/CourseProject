        <p>THE BOXER REBELLION</p>
        <p>The Dramatic Story of China's</p>
        <p>War on Foreigners That Shook the World in the Summer of 1900.</p>
        <p>By Diana Preston.</p>
        <p>Walker, $28.</p>
        <p>Diana Preston's dramatic retelling of the summer-long siege of the Peking foreign district 100 years ago -- ''a pivotal episode in China's fractured relationship with the West'' -- does much to clarify China's enduring resentment toward foreign interference. Early in 1900, the Boxer uprising spread rapidly through China's impoverished northern districts, without leader or formal organizational structure, aimed first at Christian missionaries and Chinese converts. The Boxers' name came from physical exercises they performed en masse, which they believed made them invulnerable; they could fly, spit fire, were immune to steel and lead. The Boxers' cry of ''Sha! Sha!'' (''Kill! Kill!'') was unforgettable to any who heard it, according to Preston, the author of ''A First Rate Tragedy: Robert Falcon Scott and the Race to the South Pole.'' Inside Peking's barricaded embassies, 900 foreigners and 3,000 Chinese converts endured for eight weeks the constant whistle and crack of rifle bullets, thickly swarming flies attracted by bleeding wounds and the heat and dust and ''all-pervading charnel-house smells'' of a Peking summer (''Pekin-les-Odeurs'' the French had called the capital, even in better days). Preston's account, compiled from the many letters, diaries, and memoirs by European survivors of the siege, captures an odd strain of mordant humor -- the awakening of a distinctively 20th-century sense of the absurd -- as 18 Western nationalities crowd into ever-contracting quarters, surviving on horse, pony or mule and rice, washed down with the French Legation's ample stocks of Champagne.</p>
