        <p>Gov. Paul E. Patton of Kentucky has good ties to Vice President Al Gore and will help preside over the Democratic National Convention next month, when Mr. Gore is officially nominated. But he worries about how Mr. Gore is playing around the country, especially in Kentucky, considered a swing state this year.</p>
        <p>A few weeks back, Mr. Patton, who has a tendency to say precisely what is on his mind, urged Mr. Gore to pay more attention to Kentucky, noting that Gov. George W. Bush had an edge in the polls there and had been raising a lot of money in the state.</p>
        <p>Now Mr. Patton has some more political analysis and advice for Mr. Gore -- very frank and pointed analysis and advice.</p>
        <p>Asked the other day how the Gore campaign was shaping up, he told The Courier-Journal of Louisville that the vice president's problems in Kentucky, as in the nation as a whole, were largely traceable to a lack of personality. Simple as that.</p>
        <p>''The problem with the whole campaign,'' the governor said, ''is that people know Gore and he evidently doesn't have that personality that is causing people to come to him.''</p>
        <p>What to do?</p>
        <p>Mr. Patton indicated that he thought Mr. Gore, with his latest round of attacks on Mr. Bush's record as governor of Texas, was at last on the right track.</p>
        <p>''What he has to do right now,'' Mr. Patton said, ''is he's got to bring George W. Bush's record out. We're exactly where we were in 1988, with a sitting vice president and an attractive governor who can make a good speech -- and you know who won that one.''</p>
        <p>In 1988, Vice President George Bush, Governor Bush's father, defeated Gov. Michael S. Dukakis of Massachusetts, who had led in the polls through most of the early and middle going.</p>
