        <p>Cell phones, mobile radios, faxes and tiny digital assistants were supposed to make life better in this brave new world of communications. But sometimes, it seems, they have only made it more of a trial.</p>
        <p>''I use e-mail and a fax machine and own a cell phone, but I guess I'm not beeper-literate,'' writes Phyllis Spiegel of Plainsboro, N.J.</p>
        <p>She recalls some unseasonably cold days in May, when she agreed to stay in Princeton with children of some friends who were taking a short trip to London.</p>
        <p>''The noise started the very first night I tried to sleep in the master bedroom -- the sound of what I could have sworn was a foghorn, at regular short intervals without letup,'' she writes. ''I thought it might have been the heating system in the lovely old house. The children had no idea. It was driving me nuts.</p>
        <p>''The sound continued for two more nights (and days). After the second night, I moved into the den.</p>
        <p>''The mystery was solved when my friends came home. It was a beeper, put in a basket on top of a dresser among a bunch of papers and other materials.''</p>
        <p>As a mobile radio operator and as president of Pro-Tec Mobile Communications, a wireless communications company in Casa Grande, Ariz.,  Catherine E. Sutter has heard a lot.</p>
        <p>Her supply of anecdotes about communications equipment doesn't stop with the one about the fellow who, while installing a two-way radio in a new John Deere tractor, drilled four perfect holes into a $900 fuel tank. Or the one about the installer who forgot to bolt down the front seat of a new truck after installing a radio underneath -- when the customer flipped the seat forward to store some papers, it went through the windshield.</p>
        <p>Ms. Sutter has this one to add: A married customer, partying with the boys, met a woman in a local bar.  ''Knowing he needed to buy himself some more time as they drove off in his truck to the next bar, he proceeded to call his wife from the truck phone, using the hands-free speaker,'' Ms. Sutter writes.</p>
        <p>''When the wife answered, he said he was still out with the boys, and everyone was heading out to eat dinner and he would be home later. Of course the wife complained, but she accepted his explanation.</p>
        <p>''Because of his drinking, he forgot to push the 'end' button on the phone. He then started romancing the girlfriend, suggesting a hotel and complaining about his wife.</p>
        <p>''For over 20 minutes, the wife listened to their conversation, never letting on that the hands-free speaker was still in the active mode.</p>
        <p>''Needless to say, the great benefits of cellular service caused a divorce.''</p>
        <p>A day after Jay Leno complained on ''The Tonight Show'' about the shouting of cell-phone users, Walter J. Hamilton, a retired General Electric sales representative in New Milford, N.J., went out to dinner with his wife, Barbara.</p>
        <p>In the restaurant, a cell phone rang, and a man answered and started talking loudly enough to disturb the chef in the kitchen.</p>
        <p>When the man completed his call, he said, ''Goodbye.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Hamilton then said, ''Goodbye,'' too, and a chorus of other ''goodbyes'' sounded from around the restaurant.</p>
        <p>''A wave of laughter followed,'' Mr. Hamilton writes, ''much to the discomfort of the cell-phone user.''</p>
        <p>Ari Rosenberg, a sales director at Snowball.com, an Internet company in San Francisco, was sitting out a long delay at the Los Angeles International Airport by immersing himself in a book when a woman within 10 feet of him initiated a cell phone conversation.</p>
        <p>He spent the next 10 minutes involuntarily listening to a conversation about her date the previous night with a much older man, and whether it made sense to see him again. Adding to his torture was the woman's incessant use of ''anyway.''</p>
        <p>When the call ended, Mr. Rosenberg decided to speak up. ''Excuse me, Miss,'' he said, ''but that was incredibly rude to subject us to your personal conversation for such an extended period of time.''</p>
        <p>She shot back, ''My call is no different than two people having a conversation next to you.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Rosenberg is now philosophical. ''What I learned through my experience at LAX airport is that there are two sides to this issue, much like smokers and nonsmokers. And each side is convinced its perspective is correct.</p>
        <p>''In the case of smokers, however, public-space etiquette has forced them to be more considerate of those around them. The message is that it's not wrong to smoke, but it is wrong to force your smoke on others in shared public space.</p>
        <p>''So, it may not be wrong to initiate a private cell phone conversation while sitting in a public place, but from the looks of it, it is inconsiderate.''</p>
        <p>June Lazerus of Manhattan says she was starting to believe that she had integrated the cell phone into her experiential vocabulary. Like so many other people, she was past the point where she thought people were talking to themselves on the street, in an elevator or on a bus when, in fact, they were talking on cell phones.</p>
        <p>''It took me a long time to get to this point, and I admit to some pride in having reached it,'' Ms. Lazerus says. ''Informed by my new reality, I walked past a Starbucks a few days ago and barely noted the young woman outside who was speaking to no one in particular. I was halfway across the street before I realized my mistake. She was not talking on a cell phone.</p>
        <p>''She was asking politely for passers-by to help her out with some change.''</p>
        <p>Now for the last laugh.</p>
        <p>Theatergoers are now accustomed to the pre-curtain instruction from the management to turn off all cell phones and beepers. But Geoffrey W. Jackson, a retired banker of Manhattan, says he was attending a New York City Ballet performance at the New York State Theater in Lincoln Center when he encountered a memorable version.</p>
        <p>''The announcer's own beeper,'' he said, ''went off while he was speaking.''</p>
