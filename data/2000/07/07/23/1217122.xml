        <p>At stake in the bill passed by the Senate to abolish federal estate taxes is much more than money.

But the real danger is that if inheritance taxes are eliminated, the historic and unique character of American society and culture will be placed in jeopardy.</p>
        <p>From the start, we have been a nation struggling to balance two competing values: freedom and equality. James Madison, in his defense of the Constitution, admitted that the overriding purpose of government was to protect the unequal acquisition of property. Inequality in wealth resulted from the manner in which the natural inequalities among human beings played themselves out. But Madison shared the prejudices of philosophers from Aristotle to Locke regarding the limits to the right to property. Individuals were entitled to personal wealth and property as the legitimate fruit of labor and reason. Entitlement by birth, however, was not inherently healthy; it was the distinguishing feature of an aristocratic society.</p>

        <p>At stake in the bill passed by the Senate to abolish federal estate taxes is much more than money. Most of the debate has centered on calculations about future tax revenues and notions about the role of government. But the real danger is that if inheritance taxes are eliminated, the historic and unique character of American society and culture will be placed in jeopardy.</p>
        <p>From the start, we have been a nation struggling to balance two competing values: freedom and equality. James Madison, in his defense of the Constitution, admitted that the overriding purpose of government was to protect the unequal acquisition of property. Inequality in wealth resulted from the manner in which the natural inequalities among human beings played themselves out. But Madison shared the prejudices of philosophers from Aristotle to Locke regarding the limits to the right to property. Individuals were entitled to personal wealth and property as the legitimate fruit of labor and reason. Entitlement by birth, however, was not inherently healthy; it was the distinguishing feature of an aristocratic society.</p>
        <p>Tocqueville observed in the early 19th century that primogeniture was not legally institutionalized in America, sparing the country the establishment of a permanent landed aristocracy. Since 1916, after the transformation of the nation from a primarily rural society to an industrial one, the inheritance tax has helped keep this democratizing pattern alive.</p>
        <p>Throughout the 20th century, Americans tolerated inequalities in wealth because there was a partial transfer of wealth from private hands to the public sector with the passing of each generation. Estate taxes have lent credence to the idea that there is, in our democracy, a self-renewing equality of opportunity. The dream of rags to riches has been sustained as believable in part because of the dilution of wealth at death.</p>
        <p>The Gateses and Buffetts of today have erased the power, if not the memory, of the Astors, Mellons, Carnegies and Vanderbilts of yesteryear. And in turn they, too, will become old wealth whose importance gradually erodes. In place of a European pattern of social immobility and its attendant class conflict (which helped make socialism and communism seem attractive), we have celebrated our traditions of upward mobility. Individuals born without means have been amply rewarded for their entrepreneurship, ambition and advancement.</p>
        <p>The elimination of inheritance taxes, after decades marked by the unparalleled accumulation in wealth and a widening gap between the poor and the rich, might trigger an unwillingness by Americans to continue to accept equality of opportunity as a surrogate for actual material equality. Confronted with the creation of a permanent European-style aristocracy of wealth, would we be able to sustain the hope of social mobility? The abolition of estate taxes reminds one of the ancient Greek admonition against hubris. Humans blinded by success and fortune court disaster for themselves through arrogance.</p>
        <p>The tax code should be amended to protect family farms and small businesses. The level of exemption needs to be raised. But the wealthiest Americans -- those worth tens of millions to many billions -- should not be allowed to pass on every penny of these riches to their children. The notion of completely setting inheritance taxes aside is radical.</p>
        <p>This is the long-term concern. In the short run, a different sort of negative consequence would be felt immediately if the estate tax disappeared.</p>
        <p>We have prided ourselves on the quality of our cultural institutions --  hospitals, museums, libraries, research centers, schools and colleges, performing arts institutions. We boast that America has achieved prominence in science, medicine and the arts precisely because we have supported these activities with a unique mix of private philanthropy and government subsidy, avoiding the stultifying monopoly of government funding.</p>
        <p>Estate taxes have been a key impetus behind the creation of our major foundations -- Howard Hughes, Mellon, Ford, MacArthur, Johnson, Pew, Packard -- and the gifts of great private collections to museums. Without these taxes, the endowments of our finest private institutions of culture and education would be a fraction of their size.</p>
        <p>Individuals make tax-deductible contributions not only against annual income taxes and capital gains taxes but in anticipation of the inevitability of death. As the rich become older, they reduce the amount of money they know they cannot take with them or pass on to their relatives. Estate taxes encourage the very rich in their lifetimes to devote part of their wealth to the public good. They support education, the arts, medicine and science precisely because they know that the government will take 55 cents of every dollar when they die and spend it without any direction whatsoever from them.</p>
        <p>There may have been a time in our past when religious convictions and a sense of civic obligation sufficed as a basis for philanthropy, as the examples of John D. Rockefeller and Andrew Carnegie suggest. But they were exceptions. Giving money away has always been counterintuitive. We need to preserve the traditional incentives that have proven so wise and have helped inspire the rich to contribute to the public good.</p>
        <p>Those of us who raise money on behalf of tax-exempt charities have learned that necessity has been a reliable restraint on selfishness and an inspiration to civic duty. Let us keep necessity in place for future generations in the form of inheritance taxes for the very rich.</p>
