        <p>SOMETIMES, in a busy life, the need to make art wells up unexpectedly and turns that life around. There is no way to predict the onset of this condition, nor is there any known cure. It can strike anyone, anywhere.</p>
        <p>In a garage in Oceanside, Paul Livert bolts tag-sale finds -- chandelier parts, candlestick holders, used hardware, oil burner nozzles -- onto bowling balls, turning them into striking pop-eyed creatures. His work space is cluttered with enough old balls to start a league, and heaps of future body parts. ''If you run out of potential eyes,'' he says gravely, ''you're dead.''</p>
        <p>In a cellar in Dobbs Ferry, N.Y., Robert Parker meticulously fashions champagne-cork wire, matchsticks, old fuses, coins and bits of plastic and metal into tiny, glittering chairs. He builds mysterious wooden boxes, too. ''Do You See Your Own Shadow When You Dream?'' asks one. Inside are more little objects: a chess knight, a leprechaun, stamps. ''In a dream an ear of corn could dance,'' Mr. Parker says.</p>
        <p>In an attic in Newark, Robert Bonanno bathes the tips of Crayolas in the low flame from a propane torch. Patiently he guides the melting wax onto a square of thin plywood, creating oddly shaped puddles of pure color. ''I'm 42 and still playing with crayons,'' he admits.</p>
        <p>In a house in New Haven, Winfred Rembert Sr. tools into leather the stories of his life: his near-lynching, his stint on a chain gang, the characters of his Georgia youth -- Papa Screwball, Raincoat Red, Bubba Duke. He has so many memories, he frets, ''I'll probably be dead and in my grave before all this stuff is done.''</p>
        <p>Four individualists with one life-changing compulsion: to declare themselves through art. And so they have, without formal training and with apparent success. ''What is art?'' is a question that is endlessly arguable, but all four have been invited to exhibit in galleries, and some of Mr. Livert's bowling balls have been displayed in a world-class art museum (albeit in the restrooms).</p>
        <p>Being self-taught hasn't hurt. Art may disdain labels, but in marketing, labels matter, and ''self-taught'' beckons dealers and collectors with the prospect of fresh talent.</p>
        <p>''Self-taught,'' ''outsider,'' ''visionary,'' ''folk'' -- these terms are often used interchangeably. ''There are no rigid definitions,'' said Joseph Jacobs, the curator of American art at the Newark Museum. ''It's a mess.'' Still, purists draw distinctions.</p>
        <p>''Outsider'' used to refer to self-taught artists who lived apart from society in their own worlds -- like hermits, psychic mediums and the insane -- and who created art obsessively without realizing or caring that it was art. Now ''outsider'' is sometimes casually applied to any self-taught artist working off the radar of the art world. ''It just got all garbled up in its application in America,'' said Lee Kogan, director of the Folk Art Institute at the Museum of American Folk Art in Manhattan and a proponent of ''self-taught.''</p>
        <p>Rebecca Hoffberger, the founder and director of the American Visionary Art Museum in Baltimore, said ''visionary'' sidestepped the hair-splitting discussions about in-ness and out-ness that ''outsider'' provoked. ''I have to listen,'' she said, ''to all these academicians who go, 'Oooh, is it outsider or is it insider?' 'Oooh, are they outside the mainstream or have they been corrupted now because they went to a museum and saw something else?' And it's a very boring discussion.''</p>
        <p>As for ''folk,'' a common-sense interpretation of the term would be art made by regular, well, folk. But Ms. Hoffberger said folk art arises out of an established tradition, while visionary art is one person's heartfelt cry to the world. ''Usually they've just had a life experience which is just so overwhelming, through joy or through pain, that there are no words for it and it just starts coming out as art,'' she said.</p>
        <p>The label ''self-taught'' does not imply emotional turmoil; Mr. Bonanno said his crayon art was ''just examples of techniques.'' But for him and other self-taught artists, Ms. Hoffberger's words about the visionary are apt: ''They have the conviction of their own taste. They haven't been poured through a filter of rules.''</p>
        <p>Paul Livert  Putting Human Faces On Bowling Balls</p>
        <p>At age 5, Paul Livert performed a drum-and-tap-dance routine in theaters that were so fourth-rate that the vaudevillians sneeringly called them toilets. At a robust 79, Mr. Livert was back in the toilets again, and thrilled to be there.</p>
        <p>Years ago a museum curator on Long Island termed him an outsider artist. Mr. Livert, a Brooklyn-born former record promoter who said he had helped advance the careers of the Rolling Stones, Mantovani and Tom Jones, seized on the hook. When his younger son told him about the American Visionary Art Museum in Baltimore, he began to badger Ms. Hoffberger about his bowling-ball art, or ''scrapture.''</p>
        <p>Late last year, 30-odd pieces of scrapture headed to Baltimore, where they were destined to beautify two rooms in the basement: the men's and the ladies'.</p>
        <p>''From toilet to toilet over a period of 75 years,'' Mr. Livert said with a chuckle. ''You couldn't make that up if you tried.''</p>
        <p>Because the museum is ''top of the line for outsider art,'' he said, he had no objections to his unorthodox placement: ''As long as I was within the confines of that museum, I made it!'' (His pieces were later moved to the gift shop; more than a dozen have sold.)</p>
        <p>Why bowling balls? When his family moved to Oceanside more than 40 years ago, a cousin who was a pin boy at a bowling alley started donating old scarred balls for lawn decor. When Mr. Livert's employment tapered off about 12 years ago, those balls caught his fancy. He painted and decorated them, first with plastic caps, later with brass, and ''it just grew,'' he said.</p>
        <p>Soon he was spending five to six hours a day on his art -- and not just bowling balls: tea kettles, copper pots and other gleaming discards got faces, too. For the past few years, though, he has devoted most of his time to caring for Cleo, his wife, who died of cancer last October.</p>
        <p>Asked what he was trying to say through his art, Mr. Livert snorted. If not for tenacity, Mr. Livert said, ''I would not have gotten this far. It's not because I have a vision. There's no message.''</p>
        <p>But Mr. Livert's bright blue eyes do have vision. They can look at part of a dismantled chandelier and see hair blowing in the wind.</p>
        <p>Winfred Rembert Sr.  Finding a Reason To Stop Running</p>
        <p>In a prison about 30 years ago, Winfred Rembert Sr. learned how to score pretty designs into leather pocketbooks and billfolds. But tooling and dyeing large leather canvases into story-telling works of art -- no one taught him that.</p>
        <p>His wife, Patsy, raised the idea, Mr. Rembert said: ''She said, 'You should do some pictures. You got a history that people want to know about.' '' He wasn't so sure.</p>
        <p>Mr. Rembert has always trusted his ability, said Philip McBlain, a friend and book dealer, ''but I don't think he's ever really had confidence that white folks or society at large would value what he could do.''</p>
        <p>Three years ago, Mr. Rembert put aside his doubts. Working deep into the night in the small front room of his New Haven home, he sketched a design on paper, traced it onto wet leather donated by friends, cut every line up to five times with different tools, and mixed and applied the dyes. Each piece takes at least three weeks.</p>
        <p>Steadily he preserved his memories, from his Great Aunt Lillian, a fieldworker who raised him because his mother couldn't, to the town characters of Cuthbert, Ga., where he grew up, to the cotton fields where he saw a woman give birth. And he discovered that some people would value what he could do.</p>
        <p>Beginning Aug. 22, the Yale University Art Gallery is to showcase his work. ''I think he's a real talent,'' said Jock Reynolds, the director of the gallery, who saw Mr. Rembert's art on display at McBlain Books in Hamden and went back for a second look.</p>
        <p>Mr. Rembert, 54, said he had lost too much schooling to crop work and had dropped out in the 10th grade. In 1967 he stole a car, fought with a police officer, grabbed his gun and fled. Caught, he was almost lynched, he said. He spent seven years in prison. Afterward, he married Patsy and moved north.</p>
        <p>With jobs as a longshoreman and heavy-equipment operator, Mr. Rembert supported a family that grew to eight children. But health problems sidelined him, and later he could not find work. In the 80's he briefly turned to drug dealing and served six months at a federal penitentiary, Mr. Rembert said. From sad knowledge, he taught his children that drugs were dead ends.</p>
        <p>In 1992, Winfred Rembert Jr., then 16, refused to sell drugs for a local gang and was shot protecting a younger brother from gang members. ''He's the reason that his kids wouldn't participate,'' Mrs. Rembert said of her husband. ''I think he's a wonderful human being, to have gone through the things he's gone through.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Rembert said turmoil was a constant in his life. ''I've been running all of my life, just running and running,'' he said. ''I'm hoping someday my art will be successful enough for me to stop running.''</p>
        <p>Robert Bonanno  Turning Children's Toy Into a Piece of Art</p>
        <p>From a distance, the large red triangle on Robert Bonanno's living-room wall resembled a wedge of pizza smothered in sauce. Up close, the marinara became thousands of little pillars of red crayon wax, glistening like stalagmites and formed in the same way, drop by drop.</p>
        <p>Mr. Bonanno titled the piece ''My Bleeding Heart.'' A subterranean cry of pain from the curly haired, genial Mr. Bonanno? ''Nah,'' he shrugged. ''It's just a name.''</p>
        <p>As a ''meltist'' (his word), technique dominates, said Mr. Bonanno, a carpenter by day who is married, with two sons. He developed his technique through trial and error: dripping, which he used to create the heart and some small statues; layering, or adding puddles on top of puddles; streaking, which lets him fling drops of hot wax about, and circling and staining, which create overlapping bursts of color, like a kaleidoscope before the pattern settles.</p>
        <p>Born and raised in Nutley, N.J., he started melting crayons as a lark at 15 and found Crayolas worked best. Five of his pieces are on display at the Crayola factory in Easton, Pa., one of Mr. Bonanno's favorite places.</p>
        <p>He also likes galleries and watching the people there regress as they view his work. ''It's like they just totally lose it, they go back to being a kid,'' he said. '' 'Go ahead, smell it,' I say. So you see them all dressed up and sniffing.'' The sniffers then share stories about the fun they had as children, melting crayons on heaters and hot cars, making a glorious mess. ''Everybody can relate to crayons,'' he said.</p>
        <p>His fragile artwork has cracked in extreme cold and threatened to run when displayed under glass in bright sun. In 1992, fire struck the basement of his Newark home, the heat reached the living room and most of his meltings melted.</p>
        <p>Mr. Bonanno said he felt compelled to re-create every lost piece -- ''just like an insect, building its little house again.'' His attachment is so strong that he's not eager to sell. ''They take so long to make, I try to hold on to them,'' he said.</p>
        <p>Putting down his propane torch to pose for a snapshot, he held his latest piece at an angle to display its candy-colored layers. The picture taken, he impulsively touched his art to his cheek, then smiled fondly. ''It's still warm,'' he murmured.</p>
        <p>Mary Whitfield  Expressing Compassion For Everyday Life</p>
        <p>One day around 1970, when her first two sons were small, Mary Whitfield went into her garage in West Hempstead, found some plywood and house paints, and painted a mother with a patch in her apron and a little girl ''with one big tear.'' Where the image came from, she didn't know.</p>
        <p>For a few years she painted, until everyday life -- including another son, job training and work -- pushed art aside. Suddenly, one night around 1990, she challenged herself to try again. When her new efforts received praise, she said, she ''went on a frenzy, just painting, painting, painting'' all the visions that flooded her mind.</p>
        <p>The result: gentle watercolors of everyday life in slave cabins and cotton fields, and somber, sorrowful ones of lynchings -- lifeless black bodies hanging from trees, grieving loved ones below. ''Instead of hate, I'm trying to convey compassion,'' she said. ''God allowed this to happen, and that is why I hold no hatred in my heart.''</p>
        <p>In 1996 Ms. Whitfield received a grant from the Pollock-Krasner Foundation, and in 1997, a residency at the MacDowell artists' colony in New Hampshire. She was included in three exhibitions at the American Visionary Art Museum. She has a contract for a children's book. This summer, three of her paintings were hung at the Katharina Rich Perlow Gallery in Manhattan. Oprah Winfrey owns two Whitfields.</p>
        <p>Yet life for Ms. Whitfield is a daily struggle. The slight, soft-spoken woman depends on a benefactress to pay the rent on her Port Washington apartment, where she paints on the bed. At the end of June, she did not have enough money to attend the opening of her work in Manhattan. ''I kind of cried a little to myself,'' she said, ''but I got over it.''</p>
        <p>Ms. Whitfield was born in the basement of a hospital for whites only, in Birmingham, Ala., in 1947. ''God took somebody's heart, a nurse, a doctor, or whoever,'' she said, to let her mother in. After she was born, her father walked out and she never met him.</p>
        <p>As a child, she seesawed between her strong-willed grandmother in Alabama and her mother, who moved to Long Island and worked as a domestic. Her grandmother forced her to attend civil rights gatherings and she went reluctantly, she said, both uninterested and fearful of possible violence. Only now, she said, is she learning facts about black history.</p>
        <p>Her beloved brother Gregory died in 1994, her mother in 1995 and her only sister, Albessie, in 1997, she said, plainly still grieving. She married in 1965, but the union was often troubled, and for the past few years she and her husband have lived apart, Ms. Whitfield said. Her three grown sons, all college educated, are pursuing careers in New York, New Jersey and Nevada.</p>
        <p>Her career, she said, is in God's hands. ''It's been trying, it's been hard,'' she said. ''And now I feel it's Mommy's time. And I hope I can make it as one of the black artists in this world. I ask God for that.''</p>
        <p>Bruce Morse  Following Inspiration In the Face of a Child</p>
        <p>Sometimes the tradeoffs that life demands are simply cruel. Bruce Morse of Sharon, Conn., found his art when he lost his first-born son, Jesse, 9, who died after an automobile accident in 1988.</p>
        <p>''I had the strongest desire to keep seeing his face,'' Mr. Morse said. He had never painted, but he wanted a portrait of Jesse. One attempt led to another until he was painting obsessively, he said. ''Many days I was in deep depression, but if I could just focus on the painting and finish the painting, it would bring me relief,'' he said.</p>
        <p>He quit his job as a health aide to paint full time. His marriage ended -- shaken beyond repair, he said, by the death and the recriminations that followed. He had been driving his three sons to a soccer game, Mr. Morse said, when he failed to see an oncoming, speeding truck.</p>
        <p>Mr. Morse, 56, said Jesse's death awakened him to other pain, long buried: an alcoholic mother, a distant father, his parents' divorce, his own breakdown in his 20's, when two psychiatrists diagnosed schizophrenia.</p>
        <p>All surfaced in his art. ''I couldn't have kept any of it in,'' he said. ''It's not all pretty, but it's all me.''</p>
        <p>Six years ago Mr. Morse remarried; the couple has two small daughters. Add three teenagers -- his two sons and a stepson -- and money is tight.</p>
        <p>To attract dealers and galleries that handle outsider art, Mr. Morse took photos of his work and made a brochure -- only to be told, he said, that self-promotion was ''the kiss of death'' for an outsider.</p>
        <p>''Evidently, the sort of thing they want is an artist who's completely in his own world and somebody else discovers him,'' he said. ''But nobody discovered me.''</p>
        <p>He became well-known to the people of Sharon, at least, after he chose purple paint for his garage, he said. Fanciful decorations dot his lawn, and over his front door a sign proclaims ''Gallery of Dreams.''</p>
        <p>''I didn't want people to pass here and say, 'That's where this poor man lives' and blah, blah, blah. Jesse left me a lot of joy, too,'' he said. ''Painting has given me a lot of joy and freed my soul in a lot of ways, so I count my blessings.''</p>
        <p>Robert Parker  Building Miniatures And Boxes With Locks</p>
        <p>When he starts feeling introverted, Robert Parker said, his art gets smaller and smaller. Case in point: his diminutive chairs, which represent ''the companionship of solitude.''</p>
        <p>Is the reverse also true? If so, Mr. Parker must be poised to turn extrovert, because that tiny ear of corn is history. Now, he said, he wants to make giant vegetables.</p>
        <p>Commuters can become too complacent, he said. ''What if you drove by one day and there was a six-foot carrot where there hadn't been one the day before?'' he said. ''And you drive by the next day, the carrot's gone, but up the road's a tomato?''</p>
        <p>Mr. Parker, 49, obviously enjoys the tweak. Some of his decorated boxes display prominent locks suggesting that something precious or startling is cached within.</p>
        <p>''People say, 'Can I look inside?' '' he said. ''I say, 'Well, do you dare?' '' Those who do dare find -- nothing. ''That's sort of the chance you take,'' Mr. Parker said.</p>
        <p>Similarly, one of his unlocked boxes, ''Luck,'' is adorned with coins to entice peeks. Inside is a lucky piece -- but a barrier of nails keeps eager hands away. ''You can't get luck,'' Mr. Parker said.</p>
        <p>An artist friend once used Mr. Parker's noble profile and silver-gray beard as the model for a portrait of Rip Van Winkle. The youngest of 10 children, he grew up in Harrisville, N.H. After high school came unsatisfying labor at textile mills before he landed his dream job: managing a tree farm. Living in the woods without electricity or telephone, he picked up a knife one day and started to carve.</p>
        <p>In 1979 Mr. Parker and his wife and baby daughter -- a son came later -- moved to Westchester, where his wife's family owned an art-supply store. He became vice president and stayed until 1999.</p>
        <p>Over the years, his work with wood evolved into art. He said he wanted people to see ordinary objects in a new light, so he built jointed wooden figures, three feet tall, and covered them with prosaic things like bottle caps. On one figure, a doorbell became a belly button, and a split tennis ball became -- what else? -- tennis elbow. He designed wild masks out of shiny pieces of this and that. He started showing work in galleries. He had come a long way from whittling spoons.</p>
        <p>''I didn't get up one day when I was a kid and say, 'When I grow up, I'm going to be an artist,' '' Mr. Parker said. ''You come to it. You go through life, and you start to view the world from a different angle.''</p>
