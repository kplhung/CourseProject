        <p>SING, goddess! Time to brush up our Homer. At the Salzburg Festival, which opens today and compresses a busy season's worth of music and drama into six weeks, four of the seven new opera productions take up the theme of the Trojan War, its antecedents and its aftermath. ''Les Troyens,'' by Berlioz, the grandest of them all, has its Salzburg premiere tomorrow in a production designed and directed by Herbert Wernicke, whose best work is second to none in contemporary music theater.</p>
        <p>Meanwhile, in the Rockies, the clock is ticking for the Denver Center Theater Company, which in October is to unveil John Barton's epic ''Tantalus,'' a cycle of 10 new plays on what the literati used to call ''the matter of Troy.'' (Previews begin in September.) The director Peter Hall, the founder of the Royal Shakespeare Company and an ex-director of Britain's Royal National Theater, has been rehearsing an Anglo-American ensemble of 22 since March, though at last word, Mr. Barton had yet to deliver the final chapter of his script.</p>
        <p>Who Homer was is a mystery. He may have been one poet or more than one. To him (or them) we owe the ''Iliad,'' which gives epic form to a pivotal episode in the 10th and final year of the war. We do not know whether he (or they) is (or are) likewise the author of the ''Odyssey,'' which recounts the 10-year travails of the Greek hero Ulysses on his way home. Some scholars attribute the poem to Nausicaa, a princess of the seafaring Phaeacians, who helps Ulysses at last reach the shores of Ithaca.</p>
        <p>Was Helen's the face that launched a thousand ships? Was there really a wooden horse? Who knows? All politics is local, and with the Trojan War, the memory of a minor family affair lingered to rock the known world. The eminent classicist Richmond Lattimore imagines ''a viking raid, or several such.'' At the southern entrance to the Dardanelles, late in the Bronze Age, some 3,000 years ago and hundreds of years before Homer, a city fell: business as usual. Archaeologists have unearthed no fewer than nine cities at the site, each built on the rubble of the one before. The layer that has captured the imagination of posterity, seven from the bottom, goes by the name Troy VIIa.</p>
        <p>As every grandparent who was once a schoolchild knows, the war broke out when Paris, a prince of Troy, abducted Helen, the wife of Menelaus, king of Sparta. This he did under the protection of Aphrodite, the goddess of love, whom Paris had declared the winner in a beauty contest against Hera, the queen of the gods, and Athena, the goddess of wisdom. Bound by an oath, the kings of Greece sailed off to win Helen back. After 10 years of heroic deeds and appalling slaughter on both sides, exacerbated by constant meddling from the gods, the Greeks feigned retreat, leaving behind a wooden horse, its gigantic girth filled with shock troops. Duped by portents, the jubilant Trojans hauled the horse inside their walls. Queen Hecuba could tell you the rest. But what's Hecuba to us? Like Hamlet, astonished at an actor's tears for that wretched witness of her city's downfall, we may well ask.</p>
        <p>The matter of Troy holds a singular magic. Any tale connected to Troy, no matter how tangentially, takes on an extra significance. Before the judgment of Paris, heroes' fates were merely parables of individual self-actualization. With the war, whole dynasties that had startled earth and sometimes heaven with their bravery or lawlessness suddenly entered a labyrinth of fatality immeasurably more intricate than their own.</p>
        <p>Consider Tantalus, whose name hovers over Mr. Barton's new cycle of plays though (like Godot) the character never appears. Once a playmate of the gods, he drew down their wrath when he set before them a banquet of his son's hacked limbs. ''Tantalized,'' he now thirsts and starves in hell, standing in a lake whose waters recede when he stoops to drink, beside a tree whose branches pull away when he reaches for fruit.</p>
        <p>So much for him. Yet he casts a long shadow. His criminal blood courses through the veins of the entire House of Atreus. Through the veins of his great-grandson Agamemnon, who sacrifices a daughter to raise the winds that will carry the Greek fleet to Troy -- and dies after the war at the hands of his outraged wife, Clytemnestra. Through the veins of Orestes, Agamemnon's son and avenger. Through the veins of the redemptive Iphigenia, the daughter led to the sacrificial altar.</p>
        <p>In one version of the legends, the goddess Artemis whisked Iphigenia away to serve as her priestess among the bloodthirsty barbarians of Tauris. There, years later, she would break the baleful chain of destiny and rescue her repentant brother. In the magnificent neo-Classical play Goethe wrote on Iphigenia among the savages (contemporaneous with Gluck's ''Iphigenie en Tauride,'' another opera in the Salzburg lineup), the king -- a staunch proponent of human sacrifice -- trembles to learn her pedigree.</p>
        <p>The lore of Troy flows like the mighty Amazon, fed by streams beyond number. A lost ''Epic Cycle'' of lesser poems, known only from ancient summaries, filled in what Homer left out. Further accounts, often contradicting the older sources, appear in the sometimes ironic tragedies of Athenians. The cosmopolitan Euripides even had the brass to propose that ''Helen of Troy,'' for whose sake Troy went up in flames, was not the real Helen at all. Suppose she was a phantom double installed by divine intervention in Troy while the real Helen sat out the hostilities, chaste if not patient, on some deserted seashore?</p>
        <p>Of the incidents to be re-enacted this year on the stages of Salzburg and Denver, few if any come down to us straight from Homer. Yet the ''Iliad'' -- the wrath of Achilles, robbed by Agamemnon of his war-bride; his desolation at the death of his companion Patroclus; the vicious revenge he takes on Hector -- remains primary to our understanding of any matter however remotely Trojan. Through the Olympian detachment of his descriptions and the searing intensity of his speeches, Homer draws us into a world that is at the same time ''historical'' (singular, never to be repeated) and emblematic (absolute, more real than life itself). Reading the ''Iliad,'' we approach the very limits of what heart and mind can encompass. Something of the glow reflects on the whole tradition.</p>
        <p>How does the Denver team view the original conflict? ''A nasty little war,'' Mr. Hall answered on a recent pass through New York. ''No one remembers why it's being fought.'' (Not for beauty? Not for honor?) ''No one can stop it. It's an extraordinary metaphor for the wars of the last half-century.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Barton is not only steeped in the mythology of the Greeks but also a noted Shakespearean. We shall hear, it seems safe to bet, of carnal, bloody and unnatural acts, of accidental judgments, casual slaughters, of deaths put on by cunning and forced cause, and in this upshot purposes mistook fall'n on the inventors' heads: the full Globe Theater agenda.</p>
        <p>And then some. Mr. Hall cites arcane sources according to which the scary rumblings from inside the horse were sounds of the gang rape of Neoptolemus (or Pyrrhus), son of Achilles, by his 29 shut-in brothers-in-arms, amok with pent-up testosterone. Some say that it was Neoptolemus who located the horse's trapdoor. (Who else?) Whereupon, as is more widely attested, he ran his sword through Troy's aged King Priam. Buzz, buzz! Had you heard that the youth stole into the monarch's bed disguised as a woman?</p>
        <p>''Our birth and death are known to the gods,'' Mr. Hall says. ''What comes in between belongs to us, and affords them much amusement.''  ''Tantalus,'' we may suppose, will place the audience in the bleachers with Zeus and the rest. Have we, I wonder, in our unbounded knowledge of ghastly precedent, reached a pass where the only right way to play tragedy is as farce?</p>
        <p>''Yes,'' Mr. Hall answers. ''As in Shakespeare, tragedy is close to black comedy. In ages with fixed religion and rigid philosophy -- I've never lived in an age like that -- tragedy may be noble, heroic or grand. To me, tragedy is hurtful, horrid. It shows the absurdity of men.''</p>
        <p>Hence comic?</p>
        <p>''If we laugh, it's not cruel or unfeeling,'' Mr. Hall replies. ''It's the laughter of recognition. A lot of 'Tantalus' is very funny, as politicians are funny. If you like the comedy of politicians contradicting each other on TV, you'll find it extremely entertaining.'' The look of the production will be for the most part contemporary, but the issues it means to raise are timeless, Mr. Hall says. ''The whole thing revolves around three questions. Who is to blame? What is the truth of what happened? Could it have been otherwise? And the motto for it all is 'The opposite is also true.' Groucho Marx.''</p>
        <p>By that token, the option of tragedy as a vehicle for noble, heroic and grand emotion must still be open. And a widely acclaimed touring production by the Aquila Theater Company, ''The Iliad: Book I,'' mounted on a shoestring, offers proof that it is. The visual style derives from the somber photograph ''Into the Jaws of Death,'' shot from a landing craft by a member of the United States Coast Guard on D-Day at Normandy. Not coincidentally, the image appears on the cover of Stanley Lombardo's muscular translation of the ''Iliad,'' from which Aquila has fashioned the script.</p>
        <p>Under the direction of Peter Meineck, gods and heroes wear the garb of World War II. A dream sent by Zeus in the form of Nestor to deceive the Greek commander Agamemnon descends from on high in a gas mask. If this seems gimmicky in the telling, in the theater the projection of living memory onto antiquity simply asserts, in the most unobtrusive and natural way, the invariance of the human condition across the ages. (A New York return engagement, in Hemmerdinger Hall at New York University, continues through Aug. 6.)</p>
        <p>As remarked, the Homeric afterglow has a sibylline power of its own. In his choice of subject, Virgil, poet laureate of imperial Rome, set out to catch it. His epic ''Aeneid'' -- named for Aeneas, son of Aphrodite by the Trojan Anchises, whose beauty was said to rival the gods' -- traces its hero's odyssey from burning Troy to Italy, where, after ferocious battles with the indigenous population (a kind of Latin ''Iliad''), he is destined to found Rome: a second Troy.</p>
        <p>It is, in fact, to Virgil, not Homer, that the classic account of the sack of Troy is owed. En route to Italy under divine command, Aeneas passes through the new city of Carthage, where his harrowing reminiscences touch the heart of Dido, his royal hostess, paving the way to their tragic liaison.</p>
        <p>These are the pages that inspired the grand opera of Berlioz, composed to his own libretto. In the first two acts, beginning with the discovery of the Trojan horse and ending with a mass suicide of Trojan women led by the prophetess Cassandra, the predominant mood is suitably archaic and austere. Carthage impresses the eye and ear mostly as an oasis of luxury, peace and ease, though the abandoned Dido's self-slaughter and the Carthaginians' curse on the departing Trojans (how right yet how strange an ending for this celebration of Rome's manifest destiny!) recapture the stark, brooding strain.</p>
        <p>''Les Troyens'' is the festival opera par excellence: too lavish for everyday operatic consumption, too glorious to vanish. Unlike Wagner, Berlioz had no royal patron to foot the bills for his most ambitious dreams, and he died without seeing a complete performance or even the full and correct edition of the score owed him under a contract with the publisher Choudens.</p>
        <p>BUT slowly, the work has been making the international rounds in all its uncut sublimity, sometimes spread over two evenings, with the first two acts billed as ''The Fall of Troy'' and the concluding three as ''The Trojans in Carthage.'' So far, Berlioz's masterpiece has been spared the indignities of standard-repertory routine that so often diminish ''Aida'' and ''The Ring of the Nibelung'' -- so maybe in the end the fortunes of Berlioz are proving kinder than Verdi's or Wagner's. Any ''Troyens'' is a major event.</p>
        <p>Will Mr. Wernicke's new production at Salzburg respect the letter of the Berlioz scenario? In light of the virtual requirement for name directors to invent their own (arbitrary) attitudes and imagery, it would be foolhardy to predict. But several seasons back, Mr. Wernicke's modern-dress Salzburg staging of Mussorgsky's ''Boris Godunov'' achieved as striking and persuasive a fusion of the historical with the contemporary as one could hope to see.</p>
        <p>In a remarkable vote of confidence, the Salzburg Festival has handed Mr. Wernicke Offenbach's effervescent ''opera bouffe'' ''La Belle Helene,'' as well, a mocking flashback to the start of the war. In ''The Art of Poetry,'' Horace, literary lion of ancient Rome, commended Homer's wisdom in not unreeling the tale of the Trojan War ''ab ovo,'' which is to say, from the egg: the egg fructified by the smitten Zeus when he came to Leda in the form of a swan, the egg from which hatched Helen, the most beautiful of women. Offenbach goes back to the apple: the apple Paris awarded Aphrodite. Paris -- Offenbach's rakish ''homme a la pomme'' (man with the apple) -- gaily tells us all about it.</p>
        <p>The score of Gluck's ''Iphigenie en Tau ride'' ranges with cinematic swiftness from tempestuous terror to majestic poise; as in ''Orfeo ed Euridice,'' the composer sets the moment of deepest heartbreak to a melody of celestial serenity. Staging the opera in a Baroque courtyard, the director Claus Guth and the designer Christian Schmidt have a heaven-sent opportunity, should they so choose, to present the action with a noble simplicity that conforms to the composer's.</p>
        <p>''Idomeneo,'' Mozart's contribution to Salzburg's Trojan quartet, arrives in a production by the husband-and-wife designing and directing team Ursel and Karl-Ernst Herrmann. If running true to form, they will create crisp, stylish window dressing from which any reality but that of their own decorative conceits has been banished.</p>
        <p>The opera is named for the king of Crete, who, having fought for Greece, comes home to find two princesses -- Electra, a Grecian, and Ilia, a captive Trojan -- vying for the affections of his son. A monologue for Ilia, already at a pinnacle of agitation and distress, opens the opera. ''Father, brothers, farewell,'' she cries, sweeping into her aria. ''You are no more. I have lost you.'' Grieving for them, she looks to the future. As ever in the Trojan aftermath, the past is prologue.</p>
