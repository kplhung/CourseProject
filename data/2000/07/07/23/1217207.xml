        <p>NEARLY a century ago, Bernard Darwin, who was to golf writing in Britain then what Dan Jenkins is to it in America now,  described the 17th hole at the Old Course at St. Andrews, the dreaded Road Hole, as having been ''more praised and more abused'' than any other golf hole in the world.</p>
        <p>''The green,'' Darwin wrote, ''lies between a greedy little bunker on one side and a brutally hard road on the other. Many like it, most respect it and all fear it.''</p>

        <p>NEARLY a century ago, Bernard Darwin, who was to golf writing in Britain then what Dan Jenkins is to it in America now,  described the 17th hole at the Old Course at St. Andrews, the dreaded Road Hole, as having been ''more praised and more abused'' than any other golf hole in the world.</p>
        <p>''The green,'' Darwin wrote, ''lies between a greedy little bunker on one side and a brutally hard road on the other. Many like it, most respect it and all fear it.''</p>
        <p>Over the last century nothing has changed. Over the last several centuries for that matter, nothing has changed except for the surface of the road behind the green.</p>
        <p>Once a dusty dirt path for horse-drawn carts taking farmers to market in this gray medieval town on the North Sea, it is now a crusty black tarmac. But the long angled green, the road behind it and their stern sentry, that pot bunker shaped like a mine shaft, are basically the same for Tiger Woods in this British Open as they were over the years for Old Tom Morris, Harry Vardon, Bobby Jones, Sam Snead, Arnold Palmer, Jack Nicklaus and Tom Watson.</p>
        <p>After a par 4 on this 455-yard outdoor torture chamber in each of the first two rounds, Woods had a bogey 5 there yesterday when he 3-putted from 20 feet but with a birdie 3 at the 18th he completed a 67 for a six-stroke lead going into today's finale.</p>
        <p>Through the years, the 17th has  been the pivotal hole in the British Open, but Woods has approached it with his usual clinical perspective, beginning with the blind tee shot that must be aimed over the Old Course Hotel Resort and Spa sign.</p>
        <p>''You have to step up there and choose a line, what letter in the sign you want to hit it over,'' he said. ''The letter changes every day, depending on the wind and how far you want to hit it down there. Today I went for the emblem because the wind was coming into me from the left, which means I can't drive it that far. The further you want to drive it, the more right you have to go into the lettering.</p>
        <p>''On my seven-iron, I tried to hit a one-yard draw, and I was able to do that, but it started about two yards left of where I wanted it. That's why I landed on the slope. It skipped over the Road Hole bunker slope. I had an easy putt. It broke a lot, I knew that. The speed was a little slow, so I gave it a little extra trying to get it in there. I let the blade release and coming back, I held on and yanked across it.''</p>
        <p>But on the Road Hole a bogey 5 is a virtual par for any of the world's best golfers.</p>
        <p>''It is a par 5 to me,'' Seve Ballesteros has said. ''It is the hardest hole in the world.''</p>
        <p>The ghouls in the grandstand wait like vultures for disasters. Going into today's final round, the 17th had yielded only 13 birdies as opposed to 41 double-bogeys and 12 triple-bogeys or worse. The average score there was 4.70, virtually half a stroke more treacherous than the next most difficult hole, the 430-yard 13th.</p>
        <p>In Thursday's opening round, Notah Begay was the early leader at 7 under par until he drove into the left rough on the 17th, couldn't escape on his second, then squirted his third into the Swilken Burn that usually comes into play only on the first hole. With a triple-bogey 7, he disappeared from the leaderboard.</p>
        <p>Begay was in good company in the Swilken Burn. In other years, Fred Couples and Ballesteros hit their tee shots into the burn, what in America would be called a narrow creek. Japan's Tommy Nakajima was on the leader board with his ball on the 17th green in two in 1978, but his putt curled down the slope into the sand of the deep pot bunker with the sod-packed steep wall. Slashing away with his wedge, he finally extricated his ball on the fourth try, then needed two putts for a 9.</p>
        <p>''Did you lose concentration'' he was asked.</p>
        <p>''No,'' he replied with a smile. ''I lost count.''</p>
        <p>Ever since, the Japanese pro's adventure there has been known as the Sands of Nakajima.</p>
        <p>And then there's the Road Hole's road. In 1984 Tom Watson, in a final-round duel with Ballesteros, hit a 2-iron that bounded across the green and across the road, hit the short stone wall and stopped in the grass near it. He jabbed a chip beyond the cup, then two-putted for a bogey as Ballesteros was draining a birdie putt on the 18th for what would be a two-stroke victory.</p>
        <p>In winning his third British Open, Ballesteros had only five bogies in that British Open, but three were at the Road Hole where Watson lost a chance for his sixth British Open.</p>
        <p>''When I've been asked if there was one shot in my career that I would like to be able to hit over,' Watson has said, 'it would be that 2-iron at the Road Hole. In 1984.''</p>
        <p>It's believed to be the only golf hole in the world that has had a book written about it: Sidney L. Matthew's  ''Wry Stories On the Road Hole,'' (Sleeping Bear Press, $22). One of those stories involves one David Ayton who was leading the 1885 British Open by five strokes as he walked toward the 17th green.</p>
        <p>But his chip shot squirted into the bunker. He blasted out to the road, left his fifth on the road, knocked his sixth into the bunker again, left his ball in the bunker twice, finally got on the green in nine, two-putted for an 11 and walked off the green trailing by six strokes.</p>
        <p>The beauty (and the beast) of the Old Course itself, is that it's a public course. Anyone with an accredited handicap of 24 or better can enter the daily tee-time lottery. If your name is drawn, you pay roughly $130 for the privilege of challenging the Old Course, especially the Road Hole where a visiting duffer once turned to his local caddie after his ball disappeared into the pot bunker.</p>
        <p>''What should I do now'' the visitor asked.</p>
        <p>''If I were you,'' his caddie said, ''I'd take the 9:40 train out of St. Andrews.''</p>
