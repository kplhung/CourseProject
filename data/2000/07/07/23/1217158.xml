        <p>McDonald's forces McWellness, three-year-old Swiss company that provides online health assistance to business travelers, to change its name; co-founders Barbara Staehelin and Catharina Maulbecker say they named company McWellness because they had been working at consulting firm McKinsey; their firm is now GetWellness; drawing (M)</p>

        <p>Barbara Staehelin squared off against Ronald McDonald and lost.</p>
        <p>Mrs. Staehlin says that in naming McWellness, her three-year-old company that offers health assistance over the Web to executives on the road, she meant no allusion to McDonald's.

        <p>Barbara Staehelin squared off against Ronald McDonald and lost.</p>
        <p>Mrs. Staehlin says that in naming McWellness, her three-year-old company that offers health assistance over the Web to executives on the road, she meant no allusion to McDonald's. ''We used the name because we had been working at McKinsey,'' she said, referring to the consulting firm where she met her co-founder, Catharina Maulbecker. Her own company, based in Basel, Switzerland, has won a national prize for business innovation.</p>
        <p>McDonald's, however, saw the name as trademark infringement and challenged the company's effort to register it in the United States. ''The Mc prefix is well established to be McDonald's,'' a company spokesman said. ''We do business in 119 countries where the trademark is known. It is directly connected with medical programs and hospitals'' through Ronald McDonald House charities for the families of gravely ill children.</p>
        <p>So, as of this month, McWellness is now GetWellness.</p>
