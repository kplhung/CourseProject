        <p>Movies with PG-13 rating appear to be better box office than R-rated movies in movie industry's critical summer season, though difference may not be as great as prevailing wisdom suggests; photo (M)</p>

        <p>THE story goes like this: Several people are walking down the middle of the street in the middle of the night. Suddenly, a truck comes along and flattens them. How can you tell which one is the movie studio executive? He's the guy who jumps up and says, ''Here's why that just happened.''</p>
        <p>Perfect hindsight is a common Hollywood trait. So is the ability to explain, as though to a simpleton, exactly why such-and-such a movie was a box-office bomb or why some superstar's latest movie failed to open at the levels anticipated. The constantly shifting ground upon which the Current Prevailing Wisdom rests must be updated each weekend -- especially when something comes along that contradicts the prevailing wisdom going into the weekend.</p>
        <p>Which brings up the issue of PG-13 -- at the top of the Current Prevailing Wisdom list at the moment.</p>
        <p>More and more, Hollywood studios are insisting that filmmakers guarantee they will deliver a movie that will get at most a PG-13 rating from the Motion Picture Association of America -- and not an R, which requires any moviegoer under 18 to be accompanied (theoretically) by a parent or guardian. This is stressed in cases of big summer releases, when it is important to get as many people into the theaters as possible and grease -- not restrictions -- is needed at the turnstiles. ''The question is, where does the largest audience lie?'' said Dan Fellman, president of distribution for Warner Brothers. ''At the end of the day, it's within the PG-13.''</p>
        <p>It makes sense on paper. Certainly if more people are allowed into a movie theater, then the pool of ticket buyers is larger and a movie should, by rights, have a better shot at making a bigger pile of money. But is this Current Prevailing Wisdom really correct?</p>
        <p>Follow the bouncing ball:</p>
        <p>On the weekend just before the Fourth of July, two major movies were expected to compete to be No. 1 at the box office: ''The Perfect Storm'' from Warner Brothers (rated PG-13) and ''The Patriot'' from Columbia Pictures (rated R). In the run-up to the weekend, ''The Patriot'' was widely seen as the likelier winner. Both films had top-notch directors, but ''Patriot'' had a more bankable star in Mel Gibson. Prerelease polling indicated that audiences were more eager to see the period epic. Instead, ''Perfect Storm'' ended up making almost twice as much as ''Patriot.''</p>
        <p>The Monday-morning quarterbacking settled on three explanations. ''The Patriot'' ran too long for summer audiences (160 minutes). Audiences don't really like Colonial-era stories. ''Patriot'' was rated R.</p>
        <p>Thus, it was said, PG-13 trumps R in the summer.</p>
        <p>Then came the next weekend. The only major opening was ''Scary Movie,'' a decidedly R-rated spoof of horror films. Predicted to be a decent-sized hit, it was a phenomenon, earning more than $40 million, the largest opening ever for an R-rated film. Wham! Anybody get the number of that truck?</p>
        <p>''Maybe this was the movie that was the exception to the rule,'' said Paul Dergarabedian, chairman of Exhibitor Relations, which monitors box-office performance. ''They don't come along every day, but there are some movies where the rating doesn't matter.''</p>
        <p>O.K., so PG-13 is better than R -- except sometimes.</p>
        <p>Last weekend, ''X-Men'' opened. Again, the polling predicted a sizable hit. Instead, it opened huge, earning more than $54 million. Its rating: PG-13.</p>
        <p>To get some historical context into this debate, Exhibitor Relations crunched the box-office numbers for the last three summers, the four months in which the studios do 40 percent of their annual business.</p>
        <p>Looking at the films that finished in first place in each of the 18 weekends from early May to Labor Day in 1999, a record year at the movie box office, 11 weekends saw a PG-13 movie in first place, three weekends saw a PG, one weekend saw a G and only two weekends saw an R. In 1998, it was a closer call; eight weekends had a PG-13 movie in first place, eight weekends had an R and two had a PG.</p>
        <p>In the first 11 weeks of this summer, PG-13 films were in first place on five weekends, R films on five weekends and a PG film on one weekend.</p>
        <p>So perhaps the difference between PG-13 and R isn't so great after all? Not so fast, Mr. Dergarabedian said. One must also look at revenues.</p>
        <p>Exhibitor Relations looked at all 265 films released last summer. The largest number of them, 157, were rated R. Less than half, 67, were rated PG-13. The average R film made $20 million while the average PG-13 made $35 million.</p>
        <p>''It stands to reason,'' Mr. Dergarabedian said. ''That's what R means, restricted. You're restricting the audience. But I'd hate for this somehow to cause a chilling effect on the artistic process.''</p>
