        <p>IF you don't like the way I am, just keep on steppin'.'' Those are fighting words, she knows, and Donna Marie Williams, 41, levels them equally at men who grouse about her weight (she's a plus-size and proud) and those who try to rush her into bed.</p>
        <p>Celibate by choice for the last half-dozen years, Ms. Williams hopped off the sex-and-relationship hamster wheel after the birth of her second child born outside marriage.</p>
        <p>''That's when I came to my senses,'' said Ms. Williams, a single mother and author of self-help books, recalling how she put the brakes on sex to regain a sense of independence and self-reliance. ''Before, I kind of depended on men to sustain me. Now I can do that for myself.'' The greatest benefit of living single and sex-free, she added, is ''knowing who I am.''</p>
        <p>Another sexual teetotaler, identified in a Web chat room only as 204.240.2.73, took to celibacy after a series of bad love affairs, the last of which left her picking dourly at her wounds. ''I took stock then and realized that at 36 years old, I had nothing to show for my life,'' she wrote. ''I saw other couples and wondered what was wrong with me.'' Her discovery, after 10 months of sexual abstinence, she said, is ''a self-esteem that I have never experienced.''</p>
        <p>In a culture saturated with sexual messages, where consenting adults seem to hop into bed at the bat of a feathery eyelash, a small minority are willfully dropping out of the game.</p>
        <p>Calling themselves ''born-again virgins,'' they embrace abstinence not so much on moral or religious grounds, but to cleanse themselves and reassert self-control.</p>
        <p>As old as ''Lysistrata,'' the notion of celibacy has taken on new and particular urgency for these converts, many of whom, though not all, have been singed by affairs gone wrong.</p>
        <p>There has been a recent outpouring of books, manuals and screeds advocating celibacy, including Ms. Williams's ''Sensual Celibacy'' (Simon &amp; Schuster, 1999), in which she argues that saying no to sex recharges the spirit. She urges women to pamper themselves with luxuries they might once have lavished on men: soft pillows, scented candles, decadent underwear.</p>
        <p>The most scholarly offering is ''A History of Celibacy'' (Scribner, 2000) by Elizabeth Abbott, the dean of women at Trinity College at the University of Toronto. ''Thanks in part to AIDS,'' she writes, ''and much more to a stultifying surfeit of mindless sex, celibacy has emerged from clandestineness and has crossed back into the mainstream.''</p>
        <p>That would tickle Bridget Jones, Helen Fielding's best-selling heroine, who is back in a sequel, ''Bridget Jones: The Edge of Reason'' (Viking). In it she flirts briefly with abstinence after a breakup. ''Celibacy!'' she exclaims, relieved to be able to put a name to her condition. ''I mean, if it's happening to me, chances are it's happening to lots of other people as well. Isn't that the whole point about zeitgeist?''</p>
        <p>Miramax has commissioned an original screenplay from Wendy Keller, author of ''The Cult of the Born-Again Virgin'' (Health Communications, 2000), and Iris Martin, a psychotherapist, who is one of many celibate women interviewed in the book.</p>
        <p>''There is a groundswell of women ready to curb their hormones until and unless someone worthy comes along,'' Ms. Keller writes. She and others predict that celibacy could become a ''movement'' with millions of adherents, as unlikely as that sounds at a time when sexually freewheeling women reign in television shows like ''Sex and the City.''</p>
        <p>Ms. Keller, 36, a divorced mother in Malibu, Calif., is perhaps the most vociferous cheerleader of the new celibacy. She was inspired, she said, by the women she interviewed, as well as by ''A Return to Modesty,'' Wendy Shalit's 1999 polemic against feminism, which argues that the sexual freedoms of the 1960's and 70's ultimately betrayed women.</p>
        <p>No figures are available for how many born-again virgins there are. The newly chaste (who include a tiny number of men) range from purists, who refrain from all sexual activity, to those who tailor their celibacy to suit their tastes, permitting a degree of kissing and fondling but drawing the line at penetration.</p>
        <p>A 1998 survey by the University of Chicago for the National Science Foundation found that 17.4 percent of adults over 18 had had no sex partner within 12 months. Many were elderly or had not yet married. It is unclear how many in the most sexually active years were celibate by choice.</p>
        <p>Amy Spencer, a senior editor at Glamour magazine, whose latest cover promises ''65 Intimacy Secrets Men Need You to Know by Tonight,'' scoffs at the notion of celibacy. ''It's not the sex that's bad, but the emotional baggage these women have accumulated,'' she said. ''The idea of cutting off sex is denial. It's like taking cold medicine when you have the West Nile virus. It stops the runny nose, but it doesn't change the problem.''</p>
        <p>Ms. Keller acknowledged that many of the newly celibate have been wounded in love. ''I think a lot of women come to celibacy from a position of anger -- maybe 50 percent of the women I talk to,'' she said. '' 'You're damn right, men are pigs' -- they come to me from that perspective.''</p>
        <p>In her book she advises them to stop blaming men and take responsibility for their own behavior.</p>
        <p>Ms. Abbott, the college dean and celibacy scholar, is twice divorced and the mother of a grown son. She hadn't embraced celibacy personally when she began her research, but eventually her view changed.</p>
        <p>''It occurred to me that at this stage of my life I had been celibate by happenstance,'' she said. ''I felt very tentative about my life. I saw it as incomplete, and yet I had no control over that. Maybe I would meet someone and maybe not.</p>
        <p>''Then I realized I've had children, I've been married and I've had lots and lots of sex. I decided being celibate would focus me. I would feel more in control of my life. I would try to become a more complete person. Once you know that you're celibate, you relate differently to people, you have more intensity in your relationships with men. They are deeper and more intimate.''</p>
        <p>''A lot of the new celibacy takes place in the context of a sexual revolution which went too far,'' she added. ''At its extreme it put pressure on young people to have sex because it's cool. Celibacy as an option for young people should always be out there.''</p>
        <p>Allison Saget, 40, an Internet executive from San Francisco, decided to take a timeout from sex three years ago, after a divorce.</p>
        <p>It helped her remain clear-eyed enough to sift potential lovers in her life from the losers and cads, she said. Currently in a relationship that has come to include sex, she found her self-imposed dry spell rewarding.</p>
        <p>''The longer I abstained from sex the more confident I got,'' she said.</p>
        <p>Tony Giannini, Ms. Saget's partner, found her self-assurance so attractive that he agreed to put his own libido on hold. ''Allison was intriguing,'' he recalled. ''Here was an outgoing, adventurous, very contemporary woman with values that sort of buck the trend.''</p>
        <p>Doug Carroll, 40, is that rarity, a man who is celibate by choice (and not a member of a religious order). A features writer for The Arizona Republic newspaper in Phoenix, Mr. Carroll, the divorced father of an 11-year-old son, recounted his experiences in a column last year.</p>
        <p>''I wanted to control my sexuality myself, instead of turning it over to pop culture,'' he said in an interview.</p>
        <p>He also came to share the wisdom of his sex-free female counterparts. ''Just because you're close physically,'' he told his readers, ''doesn't mean you're in the same area code emotionally.''</p>
        <p>Expecting to be labeled a hapless geek, Mr. Carroll was astonished to receive 3,000 letters and phone calls within days of writing his piece, most cheering him on, many from men. Today he is engaged to marry, but said he and his fiancee do not intend to have sex before the wedding.</p>
        <p>Mr. Carroll views celibacy as part of a journey to self-acceptance. ''At midlife,'' he wrote, ''I'm through apologizing for who I am.''</p>
