        <p>Art lovers who stay at the Chambers Hotel now under construction on 56th Street just west of Fifth Avenue will hardly find it necessary to venture out to nearby galleries to indulge their interest. The 77-room hotel, rising on a 50-foot-wide site that was formerly a parking lot, will contain more than 400 pieces of art by some 100 artists, with a minumum  of three works in each room. The hallways will be decorated by different artists, each of whom will have license to do whatever they wish.</p>
        <p>''We are in an art-conscious neighborhood, and the idea is to stick with young artists and have fun,'' said Ira Drukier, who developed the hotel with  Richard Born and Steven Caspi. ''It wouldn't be interesting to buy established artists.''</p>

        <p>Art lovers who stay at the Chambers Hotel now under construction on 56th Street just west of Fifth Avenue will hardly find it necessary to venture out to nearby galleries to indulge their interest. The 77-room hotel, rising on a 50-foot-wide site that was formerly a parking lot, will contain more than 400 pieces of art by some 100 artists, with a minumum  of three works in each room. The hallways will be decorated by different artists, each of whom will have license to do whatever they wish.</p>
        <p>''We are in an art-conscious neighborhood, and the idea is to stick with young artists and have fun,'' said Ira Drukier, who developed the hotel with  Richard Born and Steven Caspi. ''It wouldn't be interesting to buy established artists.''</p>
        <p>The ambience of the 15-story hotel is meant to evoke ''a downtown feel in the Midtown area,'' Mr. Drukier said. It was designed by David Rockwell, a New York architect whose credits include Nobu, Ruby Foo's Dim Sum and Sushi Palace, the W Hotel, and the interior of the Children's Hospital  under construction at Montefiore Medical Center.</p>
        <p>Noting that he had never done a ''from-the-ground-up building in Manhattan'' before, Mr. Rockwell said: ''Doing a small building is like putting a jigsaw puzzle together. The facade, lobby, rooms and restaurant must all work together, and that is a logistical challenge.''</p>
        <p>The exterior will be gray limestone imported from Macedonia. The lobby, whose walls will be filled with art, will have leather-covered columns and glass-enclosed balconies and a large fireplace.</p>
        <p>Walls and ceilings of the guest rooms, which will include 10 suites, will be concrete. ''Concrete is very expensive when it is used anywhere but the floor,'' Mr. Drukier said. Other contemporary touches will include exposed pipes and desks that are sheets of glass held up by leather-encased sawhorses.</p>
        <p>''The rooms will be big, like lofts,'' Mr. Rockwell said. ''We're using the notion of an artist's studio, both in the lobby and upstairs, and that is pretty unique.''</p>
        <p>The hotel plans to have an all-male housekeeping staff. ''But the doorpersons will mix men and women,'' Mr. Drukier said. There will be a restaurant, Town, owned by its chef, Geoffrey Zakarian, most recently the executive chef at Patroon.</p>
        <p>The cost of the project is in excess of $30 million.  ''We expect the average daily rate for a room to be $375, eventurally rising to $400 to $425,'' Mr. Drukier said. ''We want people to think they are getting value, so we are cheaper than the Plaza. Suites will be upward of $800.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Drukier said he and his partners had paid $6 million two years ago for the site, having passed up earlier opportunities to buy it.</p>
        <p>''There was a time when you couldn't build a hotel from the ground up in the city without going bankrupt,'' he said. ''Prices could not support the construction costs. Now the market is so strong that it is possible to make sense of it.''</p>
