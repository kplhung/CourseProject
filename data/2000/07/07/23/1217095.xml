        <p>Never underestimate the power of a park bench.</p>
        <p>A few weeks ago, Ken L. Stein, a lawyer, offered to donate $50,000 worth of benches for the Theodore Roosevelt Park at the American Museum of Natural History. But some residents say the benches will attract vagrants, trash and vermin, and these critics question Mr. Stein's motives. Now, the Department of Parks and Recreation may not accept the gift.</p>
        <p>Mr. Stein, a partner at Greenfield Stein &amp; Senior, lives in Chappaqua, N.Y., but occasionally stays at his son's apartment on West 81st Street. In October, Mr. Stein volunteered to buy 55 benches at $800 each for the park, which abuts 77th and 81st Streets, Columbus Avenue and Central Park West. The parks department drew up a plan, which allotted 18 benches to 81st Street and 15 to 77th Street.</p>
        <p>Residents on 81st Street were happy about replacing their run-down benches, but people on 77th Street, which does not have benches, objected. Mr. Stein then stipulated that the benches had to ring the park, or he would not give money for any.</p>
        <p>Outraged residents of 77th Street  say Mr. Stein is trying to punish them for a noisy dog run created last year near his son's apartment, which they did not want on their block.</p>
        <p>''This is a gift with strings attached that's being shoved down our throats,'' said Anne Snee of the Park West 77th Street Block Association.</p>
        <p>Mr. Stein said the dog run had nothing to do with his gift, and said some would prefer to keep the public park free from outsiders.</p>
        <p>''I just want benches around the park,'' he said, adding that the parks department, not he, initially chose the number and placement of benches.</p>
        <p>''I have no opposition to dog runs,'' he said. ''I had a dog once.''</p>
        <p>At a rowdy Community Board 7 meeting on July 5, board members tried to compromise with fewer or no benches along 77th Street -- but approved the plan as is. The 77th Street crowd hissed and booed.</p>
        <p>''It's all well and good that folks from Poughkeepsie enjoy the benches,'' said Andrew Albert, a board member, ''but I feel bad forcing a gift on residents who don't want it.''</p>
        <p>Dan Cohen, another board member, said: ''I live here. I'm not from Poughkeepsie, and I have a right to park benches. This is an opportunity we can't ignore.''</p>
        <p>Henry J. Stern, the parks commissioner, said: ''I knew it was an offer with a hook, but the city is not so destitute that it requires a gift to put out benches. If we want the money, we'll just say yes. We want to hear from everybody first.''</p>
